Translate from russian to english articles in EyeAuras wiki
- each of those MD files contains header at the top - it must be kept as is (aside from translating tags/headers), only update the date
- try to keep the style intact, do not overcomplicate
- Russian files are located here `ru/scripting/` (plus subfolders)
- English files must be placed into this folder `scripting/`
  Translate/touch only those files which either NOT present in English folder at all or are very obsolete (older than 6m in comparison to Russian counterpart)
