The **Key Press** node presses a key or a combination of keys. Essentially, this is a simplified version of [Send Sequence](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/send-sequence). If you need to reproduce a complex sequence, you can use the Execute Aura node + [Send Sequence](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/send-sequence).

> Important! While the trees are in alpha, to specify which input simulator and which window to use, you need to use the default parameters specified for the folder where the tree is located. Later, it will be possible to specify the simulator manually
