<p>The Window Matching Expression Control is a concept and a user interface component in EyeAuras. It allows you to define an expression to select specific window(s) based on various criteria. These expressions are supported across all actions/triggers in EyeAuras and allow you to control where to send inputs, what window should be active, what window to screenshot/record, etc.</p>

<h3>Components</h3>
<p>This control includes three components:</p>
<p><strong>Window Selection Dropdown</strong>: Clicking a small icon triggers a dropdown list of all active windows. Selecting a window from this list generates a matching expression by window handle or title.</p>
<p><strong>Expression Input Box</strong>: A text input field for entering a matching expression. The system parses this expression to determine the window(s) to select.</p>
<p><strong>Picked Window Display</strong>: This area displays the selected window(s) based on the defined expression. A tooltip with detailed window information appears when hovering over the display, aiding refinement of the expression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Creating a Matching Expression</strong></h3>
<p>Expressions can be manually entered into the input box. The system interprets these expressions as matching criteria. Here are examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Plain text</strong>: Entering "test" matches all windows with "test" in the title, using a case-insensitive partial-match search.</li>
  <li><strong>Strict text match</strong>: Quoting text with single (' ') or double (" ") quotes enforces an exact, case-sensitive match. For example, 'test' matches windows titled "test" only.</li>
  <li><strong>Regular expression match</strong>: Text formatted as /expression/ is treated as a regular expression to match window titles based on patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>By handle</strong>: You can specify the window's handle directly. Hexadecimal (e.g., 0xA) or "&amp;H" prefixed (e.g., &amp;HA) inputs match a window by its handle. Note that handles can change each time the window or application restarts.</li>
  <li><strong>By Index</strong>: Adding "#number" to an expression selects a window by its index. For example, "test #2" selects the second window with "test" in its title. "#2" selects the second window in the dropdown list.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system then shows the selected window(s) in the Picked Window Display.</p>
<p>The Window Matching Expression Control simplifies the process of customizing your experience with EyeAuras.</p>
