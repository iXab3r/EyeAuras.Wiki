<p>The Fixed Value trigger is one of the most straightforward triggers in EyeAuras. It provides an easy way to set a trigger to a fixed state, giving you more control over your automated tasks in games or other applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Configuration Options</strong></h3>
<p>The Fixed Value Trigger offers three radio button options to determine the state of the trigger:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Is Active</strong>: When this option is selected, the trigger will always be in an active state. This means that any actions or sequences linked to this trigger will be executed as long as the Aura is loaded.</li>
  <li><strong>Is NOT Active</strong>: Selecting this option will keep the trigger in an inactive state. This can be useful when you want to prevent certain actions or sequences from running.</li>
  <li><strong>Not Set</strong>: Choosing this option leaves the trigger in an Unknown state. This is equivalent to the state of an unloaded Aura. While in the Unknown state, the behavior of the trigger is not specified and therefore does not affect any actions or sequences.</li>
</ul>
