<p>This group of triggers is all about capturing image of an app/screen and further analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mouse Cursor </strong>- for some Capture methods this option allows you either to include mouse cursor onto capture image or not</li>
  <li><strong>Settings =&gt; Max Capture FPS </strong>- This is not part of each-and-every trigger configuration, but a shared option in application Settings, which hard-caps Max FPS</li>
  <li><strong>Max FPS</strong> - specifies desired number of frames per second which EyeAuras will try to capture and analyse. More FPS =&gt; more performance-hungry your trigger is. In many cases real FPS shown in the program will be less than Target because actual processing takes quite a lot of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Min FPS</strong> - &nbsp;changes trigger behavior when real FPS is less than expected, this can happen when there are not enough resources to reach selected FPS and/or calculations are just too complicated, as they are, for example, in Text Search. Basically MinFPS adds time-to-live to each individual frame and, when frame is considered obsolete, switches trigger to Unknown state, which will trigger OnExits (if trigger was <strong>Active</strong>) of all linked auras.&nbsp;<ul>
      <li>E.g. MaxFPS (aka Target FPS) = 30 <strong>(FrameTime is 1000/ 30 = 33ms)</strong>, real FPS 30 - ok, system is able to handle the load, nothing to worry about</li>
      <li>MaxFPS = 30 <strong>(33ms)</strong>, real FPS = 10 <strong>(100ms)</strong> - not ok, this means that there are not enough system resources to reach desired FPS. You may want to apply some image effects or lower image size/resolution to reach desired FPS</li>
      <li>MinFPS = 15 <strong>(66ms)</strong>, MaxFPS = 30 <strong>(33ms)</strong>, real FPS = 30 - ok, works absolutely the same as with MinFPS = 0, as in this case real fps is much higher than MinFPS</li>
      <li>MinFPS = 15 <strong>(66ms)</strong>, MaxFPS = 30 <strong>(33ms)</strong>, real FPS = 10 <strong>(100ms)</strong>, - in this case trigger will detect, that processing/capture of each individual frame takes too much time and will switch to Unknown state occasionally. More specifically, after <strong>66ms </strong>passes, trigger will switch to Unknown state for <strong>34ms. </strong>Exact time will differ from frame to frame, for example, if calculations for specific frame took <strong>200ms </strong>(which leads us to 5 FPS), trigger will switch to Unknown after 66ms and will stay that way for <strong>134ms</strong> until it gets calculations result, which will switch it back to either <strong>Active </strong>or <strong>Inactive </strong>state</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Capture methods</h3>
<p>All-in-all, two best methods are Windows Graphics and Shared Surface. These are the fastest and will work well in most cases.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows Graphics</strong> - this method uses official Windows API and is not available on OS versions lower than <strong>10.0.19041.0</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Shared Surface</strong> - GPU-based capture method which works directly with GPU RAM</li>
  <li><strong>Desktop Duplication</strong> - GPU-based capture method which works directly with GPU RAM</li>
  <li><strong>Print Window</strong> - uses quite old but stable Windows API to capture images. This method is not able to capture some windows, e.g. browsers and is considered Legacy</li>
  <li><strong>Copy Device Context </strong>- uses legacy Windows API to capture window context</li>
  <li><strong>Copy From Screen</strong> - uses legacy Windows API to copy full screen and is extremely resource inefficient</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h6>Capture methods sorted by performance (1st place is the fastest)</h6>
<p>Windows Graphics ~= Shared Surface &gt; Desktop Duplication &gt; Print Window &gt; Copy Device Context</p>

<h6><strong>Capture methods sorted by memory consumptions (1st place uses least amount of memory):</strong></h6>
