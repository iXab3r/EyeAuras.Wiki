The "Aura Is Active" trigger in EyeAuras is a powerful tool that lets you link multiple Auras together to form complex AND or OR conditions. This provides a convenient way to manage and synchronize the execution of your automated tasks across different Auras.

### **Configuration Options**

The "Aura Is Active" trigger offers two condition types:

-   **All Conditions (AND)**: When this option is selected, the trigger will be active only if *all* linked Auras are active. This means that the linked actions or sequences will execute only when all specified conditions are met.
-   **At Least One (OR)**: Selecting this option will keep the trigger active as long as *at least one* of the linked Auras is active. This allows for greater flexibility, as the linked actions or sequences will run even if just one of the specified conditions is fulfilled.

These condition types give you more control over the operation of your Auras. You can effectively manage complex situations where you want certain actions to run only if a specific set of conditions is met, or if you want to run an action as long as any one of the specified conditions is fulfilled.
