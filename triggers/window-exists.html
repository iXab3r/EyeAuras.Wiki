<p>The <code><strong>Window Exists</strong></code> trigger is designed to monitor the state of a particular window in the system. This trigger activates when the specified window is found in the system and deactivates when the window is no longer present or can't be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Target Window</h4>
<p>This option lets you specify the window that the trigger should monitor. You provide a <code><strong>Window Matching Expression</strong></code> to define the window. This expression can be specific to the window's title, handle, process, or other characteristics, making it a flexible way to pinpoint the exact window you want to track.</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to monitor a specific web browser window, you could use the title of the webpage as the window matching expression. When that webpage is open in the browser, the <code><strong>Window Exists</strong></code> trigger will activate, and it will deactivate when the webpage is closed or is no longer the active tab.</p>
<p>You can learn more about <code><strong>Window Matching Expressions</strong></code> and how to use them effectively in the <a href="https://wiki.eyeauras.net/e/en/window-matching-expressions"><u>documentation</u></a>.</p>
<p>By using the <code><strong>Window Exists</strong></code> trigger, you can make your EyeAuras configurations responsive to the state of specific windows, creating dynamic, context-aware automation setups.</p>
