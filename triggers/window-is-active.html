<p>The <code><strong>Window Is Active</strong></code> trigger is &nbsp;used to detect whether a specific window, identified by a Window Matching Expression, is in the foreground and active.</p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>This trigger works in three different states:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Active</strong>: When the specified window is in the foreground and is currently active, the trigger state is <code><strong>Active</strong></code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Inactive</strong>: If the window is minimized or not active, the trigger state switches to <code><strong>Inactive</strong></code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Unknown</strong>: If the specified window is not present in the system at all, the trigger state switches to <code><strong>Unknown</strong></code>. This means that EyeAuras doesn't have enough information to determine whether the window is active or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Options</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Target Window</strong>: This option allows you to specify the window you want to check the state for. You can use a Window Matching Expression to define the window. You can learn more about Window Matching Expressions on our <a href="https://wiki.eyeauras.net/e/en/window-matching-expressions"><u>wiki page</u></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Example Use Case</strong></h3>
<p>This trigger is a great way to make your workspace more dynamic and adaptive to your current focus.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>FPS Custom Key Binding</strong>: Let's say you have a favorite First-Person Shooter game, such as CS:GO. You want to bind a hotkey that activates an overlay showing a map of the current game level, but only when CS:GO is the active window. You create an aura with the <code><strong>Window Is Active</strong></code> trigger using the Window Matching Expression for CS:GO. Then, in the hotkey configuration, you link this hotkey to the aura, making it functional only when CS:GO is active.</li>
  <li><strong>MMORPG Quick Macros</strong>: For Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) like World of Warcraft, you may have several macros or special actions you frequently use. You can set up auras with the <code><strong>Window Is Active</strong></code> trigger for World of Warcraft and link each aura to a unique hotkey. These hotkeys can then trigger quick actions or macros, but only when World of Warcraft is the active window.</li>
  <li><strong>Racing Game Car Setup</strong>: In racing games like Forza Horizon, you might want a hotkey that opens your car setup or customization menu. You set up an aura with the <code><strong>Window Is Active</strong></code> trigger for Forza Horizon, and then you link a hotkey to this aura. This hotkey is then functional only when Forza Horizon is the active window.</li>
  <li><strong>Fortnite Layout Change</strong>: Let's say you have a particular layout or HUD you want to use specifically when playing Fortnite. You can set the <code><strong>Window Is Active</strong></code> trigger with the Window Matching Expression matching Fortnite's window. When Fortnite becomes active and is in the foreground, EyeAuras will activate this trigger and load your designated layout.</li>
  <li><strong>Streaming Alert</strong>: If you are streaming your gameplay and have a specific alert or effect you want to trigger when you open a particular game, set the <code><strong>Window Is Active</strong></code> trigger with the Window Matching Expression for that game. When the game becomes the active window, EyeAuras can trigger an alert, start a specific stream layout, or perform any other set action.</li>
</ul>
