<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>How it works?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>It allows you to select specific audio device (input/output), captures audio and measures Min/Max/Average value of played audio samples. In most cases analysis in done in 50ms "frames". If peak value in some frame is high enough ( â‰¥ <strong>Min Level</strong>) then the trigger is switched on. As soon as peak level decreases it automatically switches off.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Is it able to detect a specific sound like click, footsteps or alarm?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>No, this requires some fancy algorithms which I do not have time to research/implement atm. Maybe at some point in the future if demand will be high enough.</li>
