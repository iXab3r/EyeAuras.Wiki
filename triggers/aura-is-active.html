<p>The "Aura Is Active" trigger in EyeAuras is a powerful tool that lets you link multiple Auras together to form complex AND or OR conditions. This provides a convenient way to manage and synchronize the execution of your automated tasks across different Auras.</p>
<h3><strong>Configuration Options</strong></h3>
<p>The "Aura Is Active" trigger offers two condition types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>All Conditions (AND)</strong>: When this option is selected, the trigger will be active only if <i>all</i> linked Auras are active. This means that the linked actions or sequences will execute only when all specified conditions are met.</li>
  <li><strong>At Least One (OR)</strong>: Selecting this option will keep the trigger active as long as <i>at least one</i> of the linked Auras is active. This allows for greater flexibility, as the linked actions or sequences will run even if just one of the specified conditions is fulfilled.</li>
</ul>
<p>These condition types give you more control over the operation of your Auras. You can effectively manage complex situations where you want certain actions to run only if a specific set of conditions is met, or if you want to run an action as long as any one of the specified conditions is fulfilled.</p>
