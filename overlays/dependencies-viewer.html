<p>The Dependencies Viewer Overlay in EyeAuras provides a visual representation of the dependency structure of Auras. It allows users to get a quick overview of how different Auras are interconnected and depend on each other. This can be especially useful for complex configurations where many Auras interact in intricate ways.</p>
