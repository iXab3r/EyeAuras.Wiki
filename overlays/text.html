<p>Text Overlay is a simple yet effective overlay that displays a user-defined text inside an overlay. It shares all common options with other overlays which can be explored in more detail <a href="https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/common-options"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p>Text Overlay provides a set of options that allow for customization to fit different use cases. These options include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Text</strong></h3>
<p>The text to show. This option doesn't have any current limitations, enabling you to input any text that suits your needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Outline Thickness</strong></h3>
<p>This option allows you to specify the thickness of an outline around each character. You can adjust this setting to make the text more legible against different backgrounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Outline Color</strong></h3>
<p>This option lets you select the color of the outline around each character. This feature works in combination with Outline Thickness to improve text visibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Fit to Size</strong></h3>
<p>If enabled, this option will automatically adjust the font size depending on the overlay's content. This ensures that the text will fit inside the overlay regardless of its length.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>FontSize</strong></h3>
<p>If the 'Fit to Size' option is disabled, this option will come into play. Use this setting to specify a particular font size to display the text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>FontColor</strong></h3>
<p>This option allows you to specify the color of the text. This setting, in combination with Outline Color, can be used to ensure that your text is always clearly visible against the overlay's background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Text Anchor</strong></h3>
<p>The Text Anchor option dictates where to dock text inside an overlay. The following anchors are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TopLeft</li>
  <li>Top</li>
  <li>TopRight</li>
  <li>Right</li>
  <li>BottomRight</li>
  <li>Bottom</li>
  <li>BottomLeft</li>
  <li>Left</li>
  <li>Center</li>
</ul>
<p>The anchor points operate similarly to the standard <a href="/en/coordinate-system">overlay anchors</a>, adjusting the positioning of the text within the overlay.</p>
<p>Whether you need to display instructions, provide information, or show updates, the Text Overlay provides a versatile solution. By combining these options, you can customize your overlays to suit a wide range of applications and preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In-Game Chat Notifications</strong>: If you have specific keywords or phrases you are monitoring in the in-game chat, a text overlay can be used to alert you when these words or phrases appear. For example, in an MMORPG, you can set up an overlay to alert you when someone is looking for a group for a particular dungeon or raid.</li>
  <li><strong>Cooldown Reminders</strong>: If you're playing a game that has ability or item cooldowns, you can set up an overlay to remind you when the cooldown has expired. This can help you maximize your ability usage in games like MOBA's and MMO's.</li>
  <li><strong>Objective Notifications</strong>: In strategic games where objectives change dynamically, a text overlay can be used to keep track of current objectives and display them on the screen.</li>
  <li><strong>Health or Mana Low Alerts</strong>: In games where maintaining health or mana is crucial, you could have an overlay that alerts you when your levels drop below a certain point.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Binding Reminders</strong>: For games with complex control schemes, you can use a text overlay to remind you of key bindings for certain actions, especially if they are ones you don't use frequently.</li>
  <li><strong>Loot Alerts</strong>: In loot-heavy games, an overlay can alert you when a high-value or rare item drops.</li>
  <li><strong>Quest or Mission Instructions</strong>: If a game provides complex quests or missions, a text overlay can serve as a constant reminder of your specific goals or steps needed to complete the task.</li>
  <li><strong>High Score or Record Alerts</strong>: For competitive or speed-running games, an overlay can alert you when you're approaching or have beaten a high score or record.</li>
  <li><strong>Enemy Spawn Alerts</strong>: In games where enemies spawn at regular intervals or specific times, an overlay can alert you to prepare for the next wave or enemy spawn.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategy Reminders</strong>: In complex strategy games, you can use text overlays to remind yourself of specific strategies or counters to certain enemy tactics.</li>
</ul>
