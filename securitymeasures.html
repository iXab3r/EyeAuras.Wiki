<p>Considering the fact that program could be a subject to block for some anti-cheating systems (e.g. for Lineage 2 it is Active Anticheat), there are some built-in tools to avoid detection.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT! EyeAuras must be launched PRIOR to start of your game.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>"Security Measures" options</h3>
<p>This option enables few additional steps that try to protect the program from detection. Application start-up time will increase, in some cases it may take for up to 1 extra minute.</p>
