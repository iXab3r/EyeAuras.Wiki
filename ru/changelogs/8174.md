# Major Macros changes
Overall direction of the changes below is the following - 


## Repeat changes


Added a whole bunch of nodes/operations, which were previously supported only in [Behavior Trees](/behavior-trees/gettings-started):
- [Selector](/behavior-trees/nodes/selector) 
- [Sequence](/behavior-trees/nodes/sequence) 
- [Cooldown](/behavior-trees/nodes/cooldown) 
- [Force Failure](/behavior-trees/nodes/force-failure) 
- [Force Success](/behavior-trees/nodes/force-success) 
- [Force Success](/behavior-trees/nodes/inverter) 


```csharp
    T ProcessPixels<T>(Func<Image<Bgr, byte>, T> imageProcessor, Rectangle region = default);
    
    ...
    
    cv.ProcessPixels(image =>
    {
    	  //analyze image/do something
        return "Hello, world"; //return some extracted data
    });
```

> IMPORTANT! The pixel data you're accessing is actually shared between many triggers/components and is guaranteed to stay exactly the same only while you're **inside** processing method. If you want to modify/analyze the data afterwards - create a clone/copy it.


## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Scripting] Improved CV API - added few more overloads
