### New overlay - Custom UI - **alpha**
This is a new type of overlay which allows you to use HTML + CSS + C# to develop a fully custom user interface which will look whatever you like while maintaining full control over auras, triggers and actions. It is still in early stages of development, so there will be a lot of changes in API in the nearest future. There will be a separate Wiki page with examples and stuff soon. Meanwhile, here are some documents for technology that is used - [ASP.NET Core Razor components | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/?view=aspnetcore-7.0)

### New - [Aura Library](https://eyeauras.net/library)
This is a new way of sharing your aura packs. By default, shared aura packs are **Unlisted**, which means that they are not part of **Library**. All “old” aura packs are currently set to **Unlisted**, btw that is **~17000 packs** uploaded by all of you in scope of last two years!  As in many other similar domains, **10%** of Eye Auras users are responsible for generating about **40%** of content, I hope that by having public library these authors will be able to gain some visibility in the future.

By accessing URL given to you during Export (e.g. [https://eyeauras.net/share/S2023040514233383FuBZ1tqR1A](https://eyeauras.net/share/S2023040514233383FuBZ1tqR1A)) you can change visibility to Public, amend name and write some meaningful description.

- [**SendInput/Sequence/Text**] Key presses are now logged in Event Log
- [**PlaySound**] Audio notifications are now logged in Event Log
- Added Dependencies Graph as a separate tab, currently it shows links of selected aura/folder
- [**Bugfix**] Fixed crash when system locale is not related to UK/US/RU
