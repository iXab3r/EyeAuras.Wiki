# C# Scripting - Script Protection - *Closed Alpha*
In the changelog for the [previous version](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/changelogs/8021) I've mentioned that script compilation will be followed by script protection mechanism. It is extremely rough on edges still, so for a few weeks will be available only to very small group of people. Eventually this will become available for anyone. 

## How to use it
`Script Protection` is part of `Packaging options` and is available only when you've set `Compilation Mode` to `Binaries Only` - it does not make much sense to apply it to binaries if you're distributing source code. 
All you have to do is select desired mode, save options and upload your auras, just like you did before. Ideally, nothing should change for the end-user.

> Please note, that infrastructure for this service is still extremely unstable and there could be problems spread everywhere - even if you have access to that feature, it may be worth giving it some time to cool down.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Using dots (".") in aura names historically led to a whole group of issues as EA saves auras to your local file system using those names. And usually dot denotes file name from its extension. For now, I've made it so EA will show error when you're trying to rename to a name which contains a dot - just like it currently does for a non-valid names containing special characters.
