# C# Scripting - added ProcessPixels/CountPixels to [Computer Vision API](/scripting/api/IComputerVisionExperimentalScriptingApi)
New method which allows to get access to pixel data of the captured images. 
I've create an example which uses ProcessPixels to count pixels of a similar color in two ways - via accessing image pixels and via accessing memory directly.
Take a look [here](/scripting/examples/advanced/profiling-countpixels).


```csharp
    T ProcessPixels<T>(Func<Image<Bgr, byte>, T> imageProcessor, Rectangle region = default);
    
    ...
    
    cv.ProcessPixels(image =>
    {
    	  //analyze image/do something
        return "Hello, world"; //return some extracted data
    });
```

> IMPORTANT! The pixel data you're accessing is actually shared between many triggers/components and is guaranteed to stay exactly the same only while you're **inside** processing method. If you want to modify/analyze the data afterwards - create a clone/copy it.


## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Scripting] Improved CV API - added few more overloads
