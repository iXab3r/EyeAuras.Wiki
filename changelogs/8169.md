# Macros changes - disabled BT nodes in Macros for a while
in the latest version I've  enabled nodes such as Cooldown/Selector/Sequence for use in Macros as well. The assumption was that it will allow to create rotations a bit easier and bring in BT-goodies to Macros as well. First testing has shown, that this functionality still needs more time in the oven as it raises too many questions, especially around drag'n'drop functionality.

I've disabled those nodes for now and they will become available later, as soon as UX around them will be ready. 


## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Macros] Improved responsiveness of drag'n'drop in the tree
