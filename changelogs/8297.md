# Performance improvements - please report any issues you may notice
Huge amount of work has been done on internals of the program, too many to list. All-in-all, such things tend to lead to a string of bugs, please, pay attention to any irregularities and report them, I will be closely monitoring the inbox. 

# Behavior Trees - implemented Undo(CTRL+Z)/Redo(CTRL+Y) support 
Writing a script in `ExecuteScript` node and accidentally removing it is a pain. Been there, done that. 
This feature will allow you to easily rollback such changes on the spot. For now, Undo/Redo supports only nodes addition/removal, other nodes modifications will be added as soon as the mechanism will become stable enough.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
