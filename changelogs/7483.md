# Prototype of new links editor
Releasing new version of editor which is shown any time you links something (AuraIsActive, Enabling Conditions, etc)

![old version](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2024/09/cbQixa9Rdu0JC1E1.png)

The new one is much more flexible, so it will be easier to do any changes there. 
After current version will be stabilized, I'll add "Recent", "Favourites" and few other improvements I have in mind.
Please report any issues you'll find or any improvements you think worth doing - the initial implementation may be buggy at first, but hopefully it will quickly get it to surpass the old variant.
