# MouseMove nodes improvements
Added a whole lot of new options to MouseMove nodes which are available in [Macroses](/en/macroses/getting-started) and [BTs](/en/behavior-trees/gettings-started). 

As in [Send Sequence](/en/actions/sendinput/send-sequence) you can now bind X and Y, link auras and control where exactly to click on the found image/object. 
There are two editing modes - simple and advanced.

Advanced looks like this (yeah, it is kinda overloaded with controls).

# KeyPress node now supports mouse clicks/wheel scrolling
For now, KeyPress node will be also responsible for sending mouse-related inputs as well. 
At this point I am not 100% sure that having multiple input-nodes will be better for UX, we'll see how it goes.

# C# scripting - TextSearch improvetents - added segmentation
[TextSearch](/en/triggers/images/text-search) trigger now exposes text segments and their locations. This is currently usable only via [C# scripts](/en/scripting/getting-started) and makes it possible to click on a specific word. 

Here is an example of how it could be used - https://wiki.eyeauras.net/scripting/examples/basic/click-on-text
In the future similar functionality will be exposed via UI as well.

# Folder Defaults - added Input Smoother selection
Added input smoother selection to folder properties. 
[Input Smoother](/en/actions/sendinput/mouseinputsmoothing) controls how exactly mouse will be moved from point A to point B and in how many steps. 

As with all other settings, this one will be propagated to all items in that folder - nodes, actions, triggers, etc.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Macroses] UX improvements - better drag'n'drop, improved latency, fixed few glitches
- [EventLog] Made it so event log scrollbar will stick to the bottom even after you clear the log
- [BehaviorTrees] Fixed a problem with extra link being added in some cases
- [Scripting] Fixed a bug in CancellableMethodStatementRewriter which made it so some scripts would not compile
