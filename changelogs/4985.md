- **[ML Search]** Major performance improvements - in most cases you can expect processing performance at about **60FPS** even for large (1024x1024+) models. This opens up a whole new world for automation.  
- **[ML Search]** ML now provides a bindable position(**Bounds**, **BoundsWindow** and **BoundsScreen**) of the best match, which means it's possible to configure **SendInput** without writing a single line of code. Note than “Link aura” is not supported yet for ML, only bindings.  
- **[ML Search]** Added [YoloV8 Classification](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify/) support - basically these models provide a probability that whatever is on an image is of specific class(dog, cat, etc) without providing more details  
- **[ML Search]** Added [YoloV8 Segmentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment/) support - **extremely** powerful detection type which provides not only bounding boxes of found object, but also a mask which represent an exact form of an object. This is useful only for scripting purposes atm.  
- **[ML Search]** Fixed dozens of issues with Machine-learning-based Search  
- **[Custom UI]** A bunch of improvements - fixed few crashes, improved editor autocompletion, etc  
- **[Overlays]** Fixed deadlock that occurred when there were multiple bindings which change position of overlay at the same time (e.g. size+offset size)
