# Enabling conditions changes
Made it so only a subset of all Triggers is not available for selection as Enabling Conditions. 
Yes, that removes some flexibility from the system, e.g. you no longer can use Image analysis triggers. **But.** 
This also makes the system a bit simpler to understand, especially for new users.

Enabling conditions always meant to be global On/Off switches. If you want something more dynamic - use Trees/Macros or Auras with Triggers in them.

# Folder properties editor rework
I continue to rework existing EA components 1-by-1 to leverage new UI framework capabilities. 
Newer version of folder properties editor not only loads faster, but is also more flexible.

Legacy version

New version.
For the first revision I just wanted to reach feature-parity with existing functionality.

# Default properties in Trees/Macros
Made it so you can set Target Window/Input Simulator for each tree/macro separately. Keep in mind that they also respect the normal properties hierarchy.
E.g. if you set `Target Window` on a folder, in which Tree is located, it will respect that. But will also allow you to override that by setting another value on the tree itself.
