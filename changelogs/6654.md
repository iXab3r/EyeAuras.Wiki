## Bug reporting system improvements
Greatly improved the mechanism that accepts and parses bug reports - now I will be able to react to your reports in a much quicker fashion because each and every report will be also duplicated on EyeAuras bug tracker and in Discord. So, pretty please, write comment with some info about what you've been doing before the bug occurs if you're sending the report. It greatly helps!

And this is how it looks in Discord.

## Fixed Wait Node
Changed how Wait node operates and looks - previously there was a problem with Wait node skipping the first tick. 
Also updated documentation: https://wiki.eyeauras.net/ru/behavior-trees/nodes/wait
