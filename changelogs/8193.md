# New Node - MLSearch - prototype
![MLSearchNode](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/03/NVIDIA_Overlay_sDEeZpL9NAFREyHt.png)
New node in BTs and Macros, which allows you to run ML search over a region of a screen/window. 
It is still missing a lot of options currently present in MLSearchTrigger such as Configende/IoU thresholds, inference method, number of threads etc - those will be added in the nearest future.

Note, that by itself this node does not do anything - you have to pair it with other nodes such as `MLFindClass` or `MouseMove` to get anything from it. 
By default, it will pick the very first object and make it available for click via `MouseMove` - for some very simple scenarios that will be enough, for more complex one - use `MLFindClass`

The node will return `Success` only if there is at least one found prediction.

This node must be used in pair with `MLSearch` and allows to pick some class(~object) from the output generated by `MLSearch` - you can set some **filtering** parameters such as class name(s), minimum confidence threshold, size restrictions, etc. Those predictions which do not match any of those, will be filtered out.

Out of those predictions which will be left after **filtering**, you can make the node pick **exactly one** of them - it could be the very first in the list or the one with the highest confidence or even the one that is currently closest to the cursor. 

The node will return `Success` only if there is at least one found prediction that matches all the criteria. 

Of course, both MLSearch and MLFindClass could be used in combination with all other nodes. Here is, for example, priority-based target selection
