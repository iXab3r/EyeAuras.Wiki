## Send Input and Send Text are no longer available in UI
These 2 actions are replaced by [Send Sequence](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/send-sequence). It is easier to use and configure, especially in simple scenarios. Macro recording functionality is not fully ready yet, but I will take a look in one of the following releases, I've already got a bunch of bug reports.

p.s. old actions are still fully functional, so nothing will break, only new auras will be affected

## New window finder / click position selector
Fully replaced the old selector, which was way too laggy and unreliable. The new version should be much-much better. Please send feedback [Contacts | EyeAuras Wiki](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/contacts).

## **BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS**
- [**General**] Fixed error which prevented Cloning and Moving items up and down
- [**Image/Color/ML Search**] Changed how **Capture Borderless** option works. Still far from ideal, but should cover more cases now, especially if windows does not do anything fancy with its borders/title bar
- [**EventLog**] Fixed problem with event log being displayed outside app bounds.
- [**Synchronization**] Fixed an bug with auras not being saved after downloading new version of a sync
- [**Effects**] Fixed IsEnabled status not being saved into config (disabled effects were re-enabled at startup)
- [**Nuget in scritpts**] Package references are now partially supported by scripting subsystem
- [**EventLog**] Added “Inputs” category, which contains inputs generated by the program
- [**Scripting**] Made it so if script compiles successfully previous errors are cleared
- [**Enabling Conditions**] Fixed enabling conditions properties not being saved/loaded properly under some circumstances
- [**Overlays**] Fixed overlays “stuttering” when either user or script changed position/size of an overlay
- [**SendInputs**] Fixed problem with “Granny's Send Input” positioning (mouse was moved incorrectly on multi-monitor setups
- All inputs should be more reliable now in terms of mouse positioning - changed the way how coordinates are calculated
