## Aura Tree v2 - alpha
Rewritten Aura Tree - the thing on the left of the program where all auras management is happening - to use new UI tech. In the current iteration the goal is to replicate the existing functionality. Huge benefit of the newer UI tech is performance - it can handle even very large number of auras without any hiccups and problems.
Some known problems are still there - e.g. drag'n'dropping the aura to root folder still leads to crash. The fix will be deployed in one of the following patches.

Right now both trees co-exist and are toggleable on the fly. Performance/loading speed benefits will be seen later when **"there will be only one" (c)** left

## Configuration version control system - alpha
There is new option in Settings. It will make configuration being periodically saved into local [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repository. This opens up a bunch of possibilities:
1) Backup - Due to how Git works, it is extremely reliable, meaning that even if something bad will happen there is a very good chance that the configuration could be restored from the repository
2) History - Git allows to roll to any point of history, no matter was it 15 minutes ago or 3 months ago - everything that you've done will be logged in the repository. 
3) Remote backup - you can configure Git to push your configuration elsewhere, e.g. on a github. This way your auras will be available from anywhere.

P.S. Important! Option is available only when "File system storage" is enabled. This is already default for new users and will be switched on for everyone later in April. You can enable it yourself right now at any moment.
