# C# Scripting - Script File Provider
This is a new functionality in scripting subsystem which allows you to embed custom files right into EyeAuras - CSS/JS/Markdown/etc. 

This will allow you to use custom JS/CSS in your BlazorWindows, some configuration/data files, bring up custom DLLs, etc. 

Here is an example: https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/basic/file-provider

(`README.md` is a custom file added to the script)
```csharp
//built-in FileProvider which allows to access script environment files
var fileProvider = GetService<EyeAuras.Repl.IScriptFileProvider>();

var files = fileProvider.GetDirectoryContents("/");
Log.Info($"Script files:\n\t{files.DumpToTable()}");

var readmeContent = fileProvider.ReadAllText("README.md"); //or fileProvider.GetFileInfo() to get access to raw data
Log.Info($"README:\n{readmeContent}");
```

> For the next few weeks only subset of all file types will be supported. As soon as I'll be sure that the system works, support will be extended and **any** arbitrary file could be embedded into your script and will be available to use right from your code.
