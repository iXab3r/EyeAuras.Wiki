# Further code editor improvements - added code formatting and showing exact script lines where an error has occurred

### Including line number into error messages

Whenever scripting subsystem encounters and error, it will log the exact line of code that led to this and this info will be shown in both application logs(file) and event log.

### Code Formatting

Writing code without any kind of automatic formatting is a painful process and this feature addresses that. Now you can either press **Ctrl+Alt+Enter** or use context menu to format the document automatically. It will put in additional line breaks, missing spaces, indentation, etc. 

The current version is quite simple, but it is still much better than doing everything manually
