# Packing improvements
Now, after you've downloaded a pack from the website - be it a fishing bot for Throne&Liberty([1](https://eyeauras.net/share/S202408251113534pXhYmqPvldn) or [2](https://eyeauras.net/share/S20241122194909BA4zvIqHNV2M)), [Path of Exile Helper](https://eyeauras.net/share/S20241213181401RaWLZLE430e6) or any other one - you can now much-much easier track when it will be updated by the author. You will get a notification in the pack right away - for now it will be a small badge in the folder name. Afterwards, I may add some other form of notification.

## Pack settings merging
But just getting updates is not everything thing feature brings. More often than not, when you started using someone elses pack, you do some changes in it - set up your own keybinds, change window name, change some image, etc. Now you won't be losing those changes even when new version of the pack gets released by the author - EyeAuras will pick your local changes, compare them with author's changes(remote) and will Merge them together. Best case scenario - you get all the new changes which author of the pack did AND you have your previously done changes intact. 
This mechanism is still fresh out of the oven and could have some problems in it, but now, when this feature finally came into play, those bugs will be discovered(and fixed!) much quicker.

Ideally, you won't have to think about that system ever. We'll see how it goes :-D

## Rollback
Packs are developed by human beings, and we tend to make mistakes. All changes done by authors of the packs are versioned and stored as **revisions**. 
For now, you can reset your changes only to the current latest revision, this is equivalent of re-downloading the entire pack, but 1000 times faster. 
As soon as the mechanism will be polished enough, I will enable ability to switch between revisions.

## Preview
Another tab allows you to see how the pack looks like without even downloading it. Check hotkeys, general logic, structure. 
In one of the future updates you'll be able to check out the code and Behavior Trees/Macros as well from that very same window.

## Activity Log
And the very last tab is just another form of Event Log - it contains information about changes, current sync status and everything else around it.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Tuned memory allocations a bit - the app should consume less memory on startup.
