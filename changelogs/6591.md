# Behavior Trees - public alpha is starting!
After about **6 months** of work, I am very glad to finally kick off the public testing phase of the new tool in **EyeAuras** called **Behavior Trees**. In short, this is a new way of building logic of your bots and scripts, it is the very core of any automation. Previously, you had to use **Triggers** which brought Actions to life with **OnEnter**, **WhileActive** and **OnExit** sections. In the new approach, you will have much-much-much more extensive tooling that allows to add [cooldowns](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/cooldown), [conditions](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/selector), sub-routines (aka sub-trees) and all that powered by the new [scripting subsystem](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/getting-started). 

This is a new `"meta"` and everything that exists right now in the program will be adopted and changed to be suitable for usage in trees. The reason is that I see this mechanism as the very thing that was missing in the program - being able to quickly and easily model _something_, be it a simple clicker or a complex combat rotation. The beauty of trees is that they can do both. Yes, they definitely require _a bit_ of understanding, just like the previous system did, but it is much-much easier to manage when you have dozen of different skills, conditions, etc. Anyone, who tried to scrap something in EyeAuras that manages a bunch of different conditions (like `I am alive and I have a skill ready and HP is > 40% and I have an active target and ...`) knows what I am talking about.

# Documentation/Getting started
[English](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/gettings-started) / [Russian](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/ru/behavior-trees/gettings-started) 

p.s. I know that english version is a bit rough, but maintaining docs in two languages at the same time is a bit unrealistic, so I had to cut some corners here and used ChatGPT do automate the translation process :D I'll do some fine-tuning in the following months.

# This is still alpha!
Please, keep in mind, that BTs have been used by maybe a dozen of people in scope of closed testing phase, so there is a high chance that something may not be working, something may be inconvenient and a lot change in the next quarter. If you have any concerns or reports - please do not hesitate to [contact me](/en/contacts). 

# What is planned in the following weeks?
Right now, there are few very important pieces missing in BTs, such as:
- direct integration with input simulators
Whenever you want to move mouse or click a button, you have to use [SendSequence](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/send-sequence) action paired with [Execute Aura](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/execute-aura) behavior tree node. It kinda works, but is not very convenient. The plan is to have most actions duplicated in the tree to make them easier to use and configure
- direct integration with image search and ML search
Again, as with input simulation, right now you have to use, for exmaple, [Image Search](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/images/image-search) trigger and pair it with [Aura Is Active](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/aura-is-active) node, I'd want to make everything editable/configurable right in the tree editor
- some control flow nodes are missing, such as **Switch**, **IfThenElse** and a few other. They are not required, but are quite convenient
- the editor itself is a bit too cumbersome, I'd want to make it lighter, occupy less space and be, in general, more compact
- documentation. I want to write A LOT of docs to cover different aspects of BTs - how they work, how they could and should be used, pros and cons, etc
- scripting in scope of behavior trees. The rework of scripting system V2 was driven by BTs - since the very beginning I was planning that the most advanced users will definitely want to be able to code their custom nodes and conditions. And that is exactly what [Scripts V3]([scripting subsystem](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/getting-started) are willing to fulfill

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [YoloEase] Temporarily removed the tool from EyeAuras - very soon it will be available as a small separate open-source project
- [SendSequence] Added missing "P" to OSD keyboard
