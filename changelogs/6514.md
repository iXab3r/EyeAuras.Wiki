# New Major Release

## Performance Improvements
- **Significant** performance improvements in launch times, memory usage at startup and during operation, CPU, and GPU usage for search, and configuration handling efficiency. 
- Implemented a few systems which are disabled by default in the current release, but will be tested and verified in Alpha branch starting next week. You can try them out yourself by enabling "**File system storage(alpha)**" in **Settings** - by ready for some potential issues though. 
- Tests show that, in most scenarios, machine learning-based search is now about ~15% faster overall, with some extreme cases being twice as fast as before. The main parameter improved is **latency**, so the program now reacts much faster to anything that happens on the screen - at each stage in the system (capturing the image, applying effects/resizing, preparing it for ML/image analysis, and delivering analysis results (predictions and found bounding boxes)) are now delivered to triggers **much faster**. In some cases, latency has dropped from the millisecond range (i.e., **1+ millisecond**) to less than **100 microseconds**. This will be very noticeable in high-frequency scenarios, like reacting to some object on the screen (e.g., item positions on the ground in Path of Exile or aimbot-like minigames where you have to track the object). 
- This is not the latest iteration of improvements. I am planning at least two more significant improvements (mainly in machine learning areas), but they will be delivered later, probably even after the next large release to the “Stable” channel at the end of Feb.

## Image/Color/ML/Text Search Triggers - UI Rework 
- Added sections and hidden some advanced options by default (like adding offsets/anchors).
- Major rework of region selection and capture image preview.  
- Gradual Zoom - now you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out. Hold the **left** mouse button to pan the image.
- Selection rework - now you can select a region on a preview and use **Ctrl+C** or a button from the toolbar to copy part of the image to the clipboard or use it as a search template.
- Save screenshot/video - this was available for quite some time in the Effects window, UI has changed and now it is available in the preview pane for easier access.
- Video playback [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Di5ax95Fo) -  you can now **load any video** in the Preview pane and use it for extracting a template image out of it or picking the correct capture region.

## New Window Finder / Click Position Selector
- Fully replaced the old selector, which was too laggy and unreliable. Just drag the icon anywhere, and the program will pick up the window/position.
NOTE: It does not support clicking on the button & selecting the window afterwards, only dragging. Will be added in one of the future versions.

## Scripts v3.0  
- **Huge** update to the scripting subsystem. This was all done as part of work around **Behaviour Trees** - since the very beginning, having a fast and convenient way to prepare smaller bits of code embedded right into the tree itself was a major goal, and the current implementation is too heavy for that - it is powerful, but too verbose and heavyweight.  
- Started writing **[documentation](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/getting-started)**, available here with a few examples - [Hello,World](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/basic/hello-world), [printing text](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/basic/send-text), [moving the cursor](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/basic/send-mouse-center) with more to come
- It is now in the early testing phase, and in the coming weeks, there will be a bunch of scripting-related updates, but if you want to start coding - do not hesitate to try out the newer system and, if you have any questions, contact me on Discord and ask anything.
- NuGet packages - they are already supported but are disabled for now. I want to clean up all potential internal issues first and after that allow people to use external dependencies. Will enable them a bit later. If you really want to try them out now - contact me on Discord.
- C# script **Action** and **Trigger** are already using **v3**, but **WebUI** is still on **v2**. The reason is that **WebUI** has several features that still require porting from **v2** to **v3** to match the expected functionality, e.g., exporting/importing code as a **C# project**. This will be implemented in the nearest weeks and released as part of a separate update.

## Major Code Editor Improvements - Quick Fixes, Errors Highlighting, Tooltips, Signature Help, etc.
- Error highlighting: Now, whenever some error is encountered in a script, there will be special markup showing that something is wrong in the code with a detailed description of the error. Note that it is reflected on both the scrollbar and the codemap as well.

- Errors Quick fixes: If there is some well-known way to resolve an error, such as adding an additional import (**using …**), there will be a special button shown in the popup called “**Quick Fix…**”. Click on it, and the program will give you one or multiple potential quick fixes. The names are not very human-readable at the moment, and I'll work on that in future versions.

- Code completion improvements: Prototype of the documentation pane which will be showing XML docs right next to the method/property name. Currently in a very alpha-rough stage, no markup, no highlighting, etc.

## Send Input and Send Text are No Longer Available in UI
- These 2 actions are replaced by [Send Sequence](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/send-sequence). It is easier to use and configure, especially in simple scenarios. Macro recording functionality is not fully ready yet.
- Old actions are still fully functional, so nothing will break, only new auras will be affected.

## New Input Type - Granny's Send Input
- Added a new method of input. That one is quite old and this is the exact reason why many protections just forget that it exists. Helps to keep things under the radar.

## Changed Auto-Update Download Source
- Updates for the program were downloaded from Microsoft Azure cloud, with the expectation that due to vast infrastructure capabilities, download speed would be great in all regions, but… it ended up being worse than from a single server in Saint Petersburg. 
- Since this update, the program will download its updates from one of multiple servers located in Frankfurt, Germany, which is a major hub, and this should give most users at least “good enough” download speed. We'll see how it goes, and maybe I'll scale up that same approach and use multi-regional hosting as well. The current system allows me to fully control from which exact server the download will happen, so there is a wide range of control and possible improvements.
- By the way, I'd want to remind you about a very useful option, located in **Settings**, called **Automatically download updates**. What it does is, well, it downloads updates… automatically. **But does not apply them!** Meaning that it won't break anything, the only difference from a fully manual update is that you will skip the download time.

## Network Messages Broadcasting Functionality (Early-Early Alpha)
[Send Message](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/send-network-message) / [Network Message](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/network-message) action/trigger pair is a powerful tool that can help you build your own controllable network of inter-connected EyeAuras. This has been available for a few years at this point and is used mostly for multi-boxing (on multiple PCs) purposes.

What was always a problem is latency - all messages had to come through one of EyeAuras servers, which introduced latency. The new broadcasting mode allows you to use your **local network** to exchange messages between PCs, which basically eliminates any latency.

The feature is still in early alpha and very rough on the configuration side of things - you have to specify the IP manually, for example. Also, it may not work in some configurations where routers do not support [multicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast). Also, the feature is not properly tested yet, so use it with discretion.

To use this new feature, set **ChannelId** to:

- On **Server** EyeAuras (one that listens for messages) - set **broadcast://255.255.255.255/anychannelname**
- On **Client** EyeAuras (one that sends messages) - set **broadcast://255.255.255.255/anychannelname**

p.s. by default, the program uses port **53082** for communications, but you can pick any other port if you want, right after **IP** in **ChannelId** (e.g., **broadcast://255.255.255.255:55055/anychannelname**)

## Behaviour Trees
- In 1 week or so, the functionality will become available in the alpha branch. This highly depends on the number of bugs which will be discovered after the publication of the current version to the main branch.


## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Crash] Fixed a rare crash during import (ReplaceId NullReferenceException).
- [Crash] Fixed a rare crash in LegacyScriptReferencesResolver.
- [Crash] Fixed a crash that sometimes happened during startup "Container must be defined (Parameter 'container')".
- [PlaySound] Fixed a bug that would not allow creating this action via UI.
- [PlaySound] Fixed a bug that sometimes reverted the selected notification to Disabled.
- [UI] When an aura has only **1** action/trigger/overlay, the editor for that item will be expanded to occupy all available space. This should make working with such auras a much more pleasant experience, especially after I adapt all editors to benefit from that change.
- [UI] Completely rewritten secondary panel with log and variables.
- [UI] All windows and overlays now open faster.
- [UI] The Import dialog can now perform Synchronization as well.
- [UI] Added a **Getting Started** pane which is displayed in empty Auras. It has **Import**/**Subscribe** buttons which should make life easier for guys who just want to use someone else's aura pack.
- [UI] Fixed an error which prevented Cloning and Moving items up and down.
- [UI] Fixed a problem with Replay not working correctly with low FPS.
- [WindowSelector] The WindowSelector now captures the process name as a final argument. Previously, when you picked a window, the program captured “**Window handle OR Window Title**”. Now it is “**Window Handle OR Window Title OR Process Name**”.
- [Scripting] Numerous improvements in the scripting subsystem - it's now faster and more memory-efficient.
- [Scripting] ImageSharp library added to the SDK. In some aspects, it's more convenient than OpenCV, and likely, future APIs will be built around it.
- [Scripting] Made it so if a script compiles successfully previous errors are cleared.
- [Scripting] Fixed a problem with Code editor tabs not selecting files properly when changed.
- [General] Improved the accuracy of all waits and delays, now with a margin of error within 1ms.
- [Search Triggers] Fixed a bug with some capture sources (e.g., **Shared Surface**) that happened when **Capture Borderless** is selected.
- [Search Triggers] Changed how **Capture Borderless** option works. Still far from ideal, but should cover more cases now, especially if windows do not do anything fancy with its borders/title bar.
- [Search Triggers] Fixed “Task canceled” exception being shown in UI.
- [Text Search] Fixed a crash that happened when a trigger with running text recognition was disabled by enabling condition.
- [Bugfix] Fixed a bug which in some cases led to the program deadlocking at startup (a very long-living and nasty bug, hopefully, it is finally dead).
- [Bugfix] Fixed a bug in the aura selection window - in some cases, auras were hidden and not available for selection.
- [Bugfix] Fixed a bug that would crash UI when items were reordered.
- [Bugfix] Fixed a bug in [**Replica**](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/replica) overlays - **Keep Aspect Ratio** was not properly calculating width/height of the overlay when the source was resized.
- [EventLog] Fixed a problem with the event log being displayed outside app bounds.
- [EventLog] Added an “Inputs” category, which contains inputs generated by the program.
- [Synchronization] Fixed a bug that caused the program to crash if synchronization was added inside a folder that was already synchronized.
- [Synchronization] Fixed a bug with auras not being saved after downloading a new version of a sync.
- [Effects] Fixed IsEnabled status not being saved into config (disabled effects were re-enabled at startup).
- [Enabling Conditions] Fixed enabling conditions properties not being saved/loaded properly under some circumstances.
- [Overlays] Fixed overlays “stuttering” when either user or script changed the position/size of an overlay.
- [SendInputs] Fixed a problem with “Granny's Send Input” positioning (the mouse was moved incorrectly on multi-monitor setups).
- All inputs should be more reliable now in terms of mouse positioning - changed the way how coordinates are calculated.
- [C# Action/Trigger] Added a few more options like automatic stop of the script if it is running for too long + a few other UI/UX tweaks.  
- Done some documentation updates which are reflected in both the SDK and on the [website](https://docs.eyeauras.net/). In the following weeks, there will be a bunch of articles/examples focusing on the beginner audience.
