# New major release



## Performance Improvements
- Significant performance improvements in launch times, memory usage at startup and during operation, CPU and GPU usage for search, and configuration handling efficiency.
- Added several subsystems for more effective identification and addressing of problem areas.
- Notable issues include memory consumption at startup and overall responsiveness of the interface. Solutions are being gradually implemented.
- Tests are showing, that in most scenarios machine learning-based search is now about ~15% faster overall, with some extreme cases being twice as fast as they were before. But the main parameter which was improved is **latency**. So now the program reacts much-much faster on anything that happens on the screen - at each stage in the system (capturing the image, applying effects/resizing, preparing it for ML/image analysis and delivering analysis results (predictions and found bounding boxes) are now delivered to triggers **much-much** faster. In some cases latency has dropped from millisecond-range (i.e. **1+ millisecond**) to less than **100 microseconds**. This will be very noticeable in high-frequency scenarios, like trying to react on some object on the screen (e.g. item positions on the ground in Path of Exile or aimbot-like minigames where you have to track the object. This is not the latest iteration of improvements, I am planning at least two more large improvements (mainly in machine-learning areas), but they will be delivered later, probably even after the next large release to “Stable” channel at the end of Feb.

## Rework of Preview window in Image/Color/ML/Text Search triggers
- Major rework of region selection and capture image preview.  
- Gradual Zoom - now you can use mouse wheel to zoom in/out. Hold **left** mouse button to pan the image
- Selection rework - now you can select region on a preview and use **Ctrl+C** or button from toolbar to copy part of the image to clipboard or use it as search template
- Save screenshot / video - this was available for quite some time in Effects window, UI has changed and now it is available in the preview pane for easier access
- Video playback - you can now **load any video** in Preview pane and use it for extracting template image out of it or picking a correct capture region.


## New window finder / click position selector
- Fully replaced the old selector, which was way too laggy and unreliable. Just drag the icon anywhere and the program will pick up window/position.

## Scripts v3.0  
- **Huge** update to the scripting subsystem. This was all done as a part of work around **Behaviour Trees** - since the very beginning having fast and convenient way to prepare smaller bits of code embedded right into the tree itself was a major goal  and the current implementation is way too heavy for that - it is powerful, but too verbose and heavyweight.  
- Right now it is early testing phase and in the coming weeks there will be a bunch of scripting related updates, but if you want to start coding - do not hesitate to try out the newer system and, if you have any questions, contact me in Discord and ask anything. Me and **linqse** will do our best on writing documentation about the new API with examples and everything.  
- Nuget packages - they are already supported, but are disabled for now. I want to cleanup all potential internal issues first and after that allow people to use external dependencies
- C# script **Action** and **Trigger** are already using **v3**, but **WebUI** is still on **v2**. Reason is that **WebUI** has several features that still require porting them from **v2** to **v3** to match the expected functionality, e.g. exporting/importing code as **C# project**. This will be implemented in the nearest weeks and released as a part of separate update


## Major code editor improvements - quick fixes, errors highlighting, tooltips, signature help, etc
- Error highlighting: Now whenever some error is encountered in a script, there will be a special markup showing that something is wrong in the code with detailed description of an error. Note that it is reflected on both the scrollbar and the codemap as well.

- Errors Quick fixes: If there is some well-known way to resolve an error, such as adding an additional import (**using …**), there will be a special button shown in the popup called “**Quick Fix…**”, click on it and the program will give you one or multiple potential quick fixes. The names are not very human-readable at the moment and I'll work on that in one of future versions

- Code completion improvements: Prototype of documentation pane which will be showing XML docs right next to method/property name. Currently in very alpha-rough stage, no markup, no highlighting, etc


## Send Input and Send Text are no longer available in UI
- These 2 actions are replaced by [Send Sequence](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/send-sequence). It is easier to use and configure, especially in simple scenarios. Macro recording functionality is not fully ready yet.
- Old actions are still fully functional, so nothing will break, only new auras will be affected.

## Network messages broadcasting functionality (early-early alpha)
[Send Message](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/send-network-message) / [Network Message](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/network-message) action/trigger pair is a powerful tool that can help you to build your own controllable network of inter-connected EyeAuras. This has been available for a few years at that point and is used mostly for multi-boxing (on multiple PCs) purposes.

What was always a problem is latency - all messages had to come through one of EyeAuras servers, which introduced latency. New broadcasting mode allows you to use your **local network** to exchange messages between PCs. This basically eliminates any latency.

The feature is still in early alpha and very rough on configuration side of things - you have to specify IP manually, for example. Also it may not work in some configurations where routers do not support [multi-cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast#:~:text=In%20computer%20networking%2C%20multicast%20is,point%2Dto%2Dmultipoint%20communication.). 
Also the feature is not property tested yet, so use with discretion


To use this new feature, set **ChannelId** to:

- On **Server** EyeAuras (one that listens for messages) - set **broadcast://255.255.255.255/anychannelname**
- On **Client** EyeAuras (one which sends messages) - set **broadcast://255.255.255.255/anychannelname**

p.s. by default, the program uses port **53082** for communications, you can pick any other port if you want right after **IP** in **ChannelId** (e.g. **broadcast://255/255.255.255:55055/anychannelname**)

## New Input Type - Granny's Send Input
- Added a new method of input, useful if other methods are not working for some reason.

## Behaviour Trees
- In 1 week or so the functionality will become available in alpha branch. This highly depends on number of bugs which will be discovered after publication of current version to the main branch. 

## Changed auto-update download source
- Updates for the program were downloaded from Microsoft Azure cloud, the expectation was that due to vast infrastructure capabilities, download speed will be great in all regions, but… it ended up being worse than from a single server in Saint-Petersburg. 
- Since this update, the program will download its updates from one of multiple servers located in Frankfurt, Germany, which is a major hub and this should give most users at least “good enough” download speed. We'll see how it goes and maybe I'll scale up that same approach and use multi-regional hosting as well. The current system allows me to fully control from which exact server the download will happen, so there is a wide range of control and possible improvements.
- By the way, I'd want to remind about very-very useful option, located in **Settings,** called **Automatically download updates**. What it does is, well, it downloads updates… automatically. **But does not apply them!** Meaning that it won't break anything, the only difference from fully manual update is that you will skip download time.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Crash] Fixed a rare crash during import (ReplaceId NullReferenceException).
- [Crash] Fixed rare crash in LegacyScriptReferencesResolver
- [PlaySound] Fixed bug that would not allow to create this action via UI
- [PlaySound] Fixed bug that sometimes reverted selected notification to Disabled
- [UI] When aura has only **1** action/trigger/overlay, the editor for that item will be expanded to occupy all available space. This should make working with such auras much more pleasant experience, especially after I'll adapt all editors to benefit from that change.
- [UI] Completely rewritten secondary panel with log and variables.
- [UI] All windows and overlays now open faster.
- [UI] Import dialog can now perform Synchronization as well.
- [UI] Added **Getting Started** pane which is displayed in empty Auras. It has **Import**/**Subscribe** buttons which should make life easier for guys who just want to use someone else's aura pack
- [UI] Fixed error which prevented Cloning and Moving items up and down
- [WindowSelector] WindowSelector now captures process name as a final argument. Previously, when you picked a window, the program captured “**Window handle OR Window Title**”. Now it is “**Window Handle OR Window Title OR Process Name**”
- [Scripting] Numerous improvements in the scripting subsystem - it's now faster and more memory-efficient.
- [Scripting] ImageSharp library added to the SDK. In some aspects, it's more convenient than OpenCV, and likely, future APIs will be built around it.
- [Scripting] Made it so if script compiles successfully previous errors are cleared
- [General] Improved accuracy of all waits and delays, now with a margin of error within 1ms.
- [Search Triggers] Fixed bug with some capture sources(e.g. **Shared Surface**) that happened when **Capture Borderless** is selected
- [Search Triggers] Changed how **Capture Borderless** option works. Still far from ideal, but should cover more cases now, especially if windows does not do anything fancy with its borders/title bar
- [Search Triggers] Fixed “Task cancelled” exception being shown in UI  
- [Text Search] Fixed crash that happened when trigger with running text recognition was disabled by enabling condition  
- [Bugfix] Fixed a bug which in some cases led to program deadlocking at startup (very long-living and nasty bug, hopefully it is finally dead)
- [Bugfix] Fixed bug in aura selection window - in some cases auras were hidden and not available for selection
- [Bugfix] Fixed bug that would crash UI when items were reordered
- [Bugfix] Fixed bug in [**Replica**](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/replica) overlays - **Keep Aspect Ratio** was not properly calculating width/height of the overlay when source was resized
- [EventLog] Fixed problem with event log being displayed outside app bounds.
- [EventLog] Added “Inputs” category, which contains inputs generated by the program
- [Synchronization] Fixed a bug that caused the program to crash if synchronization was added inside a folder that was already synchronized.
- [Synchronization] Fixed an bug with auras not being saved after downloading new version of a sync
- [Effects] Fixed IsEnabled status not being saved into config (disabled effects were re-enabled at startup)
- [Enabling Conditions] Fixed enabling conditions properties not being saved/loaded properly under some circumstances
- [Overlays] Fixed overlays “stuttering” when either user or script changed position/size of an overlay
- [SendInputs] Fixed problem with “Granny's Send Input” positioning (mouse was moved incorrectly on multi-monitor setups
- All inputs should be more reliable now in terms of mouse positioning - changed the way how coordinates are calculated
- [C# Action/Trigger] Added few more options like automatic stop of the script if it is running for too long + few other UI/UX tweaks  
- Done some documentation updates which are reflected in both the SDK and on a [website](https://docs.eyeauras.net/). In the following weeks there will be a bunch of articles/examples focusing at beginner auditory
