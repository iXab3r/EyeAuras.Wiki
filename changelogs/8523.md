# C# Scripting - added two new ML+OSD examples
Fixed the problem with ComputerVision API not resolving models/images via HTTP links and created two examples:

### [Aim Trainer 2D ML Aimbot+ESP](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/advanced/aimtracker-ml-ea)
In this one I am showing how to:
- find a window by title
- create ComputerVision that you could use to find images, do ML, OCR and other things
- create SendInput which you could use to simulate inputs
- create OnScreenCanvas which you could use to draw things on the screen
- find object via pre-trained ML-model 
- move mouse and click at the center of it
- draw current window position/object position on the screen via OSD (on-screen-display)

Realistically, these three combined are more than enough to create a bot :) All the tools are right there in the box.

### [Aim Trainer 2D ML Aimbot+ESP ImGui](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/advanced/aimtracker-ml)
Verrry similar to the one above, except for a fact that it uses [ImGui](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/imgui/getting-started) - immensely powerful drawing library that could be to create UIs as well as draw boxes/text/etc right there on the screen.
