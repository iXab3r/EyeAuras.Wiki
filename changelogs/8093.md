## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Fixed a problem with Packs - License Agreement window closure led to app termination. That happened only on the 1st launch.
- [UI] License Agreement Window refactoring - should load up faster
- [UI] Fixed a problem with application manifest which made it so the app had to restart to gain admin priveleges. This still has to be tested on different OS versions
