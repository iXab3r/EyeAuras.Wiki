# [Enabling Conditions](/en/features/enabling-conditions) rework
A lot of internal changes in the mechanism powering enabling conditions. Some of them were towards bugfixes, some of them towards better UX.

- Now, if trigger is disabled due to enabling conditions not bein met, there will be a huge orange label stating such. 
- If you mouse over this label, there will be a *very* detailed information which will allow you to track down what exactly is affecting that trigger. Right now this block is very technical, but it explicitly states items which have affected disablement status
- If an aura is selected and main window is in focus right now - all enabling conditions are ignored, allowing you to debug it
- Similar logic applied if a folder is selected - all child items enabling conditions are ignored, allowing you to debug groups of overlays, for example
- Fixed bug which sometimes occurred on application startup which disabled auras despite enabling conditions status

# Triggers/Actions/Overlays are now minimizable
This state is persisted as a part of item configuration meaning it will stay that way until you'll change it again.

# [HotkeyIsActive](/en/triggers/hotkey-is-active) further improvements

Applied some face-lifting to how HotkeyIsActive looks and works. 
- Added tooltips 
- Improved mechanism of linking Auras in the Trigger - Interception Conditions, more on them below

## Interception conditions
In fact, they have existed for ages (multiple years at this point), but they were not given enough publicity despite the fact that they are extremely useful in some cases.
All-in-all, this mechanism is directly responsible for enabling/disabling hotkeys handling at any given moment. By adding one or multiple auras you can specify exact set of conditions, which must be met before Trigger will start doing anything. 

For example, by linking Aura which has [WindowIsActive](/en/triggers/window-is-active) in it, you will make Trigger react only to keys which were pressed while game window is active.
In more complex cases, you can link the trigger to some in-game condition, for example, you when you click RMB(part of HotkeyIsActive configuration) **AND** some powerful skill is off-cooldown(linked condition), instead of casting whatever is usually on RMB, you'll simulate key press of a button which casts that skill. A good example would be automating cast of Vaal Skills on Path of Exile - you have the usual version of a skill bound to some button which you spam and whenever Vaal version got enough souls, it will be automatically release without you having to remember about it.

To better understand why two next options are needed, let me provide an example:
I have HotkeyIsActive tracking presses of `F3` in `Toggle mode`, meaning that when I first press on `F3`, trigger `activates` and to `deactivate` it I have to do a second press. Very simple and very useful to enable/disable some more complex auras (like auto-potions). Also I've set the option `Suppress Key` which blocks `F3` from reaching game window at all - otherwise the game could react to something bound to `F3`. What is bad in this configuration is that if I leave it as is, `F3` would be blocked in all applications, not only in my game - not really convenient, if you ask me. 
To fix that, I can add `Interception condition` with [WindowIsActive](/en/triggers/window-is-active) and this will restrict `F3` to that single game window. Kinda works, but there are two problems with this:

### Interception conditions - Ignore if Hotkey is set
**Problem:** 
To disable HotkeyIsActive, I now have to have game window to be in focus. So if I want to disable _something_ that is bound to `F3`, I have to activate game window first. If that `F3` enabled some kind of an aggressive clicker, getting your window back to foreground could be challenging at times. 

**Solution:** 
By setting this option, you can now make it so **enabling** the trigger can be done only while game window is active, but **disabling** it could be done from anywhere. Forgot to turn off your clicker before alt-tabbing? Not a problem, just hit `F3` again and the trigger will be disabled. 
Note that this option will have effect only if toggle is currently active.

### Interception conditions - Automatically deactivate Trigger
**Problem:**
There is no way to quickly disable HotkeyIsActive - you have to click the button. In some cases this is not very convenient - you have to remember that some automation currently runs. You alt-tab and forget about it. Then, out of nowhere, some trigger condition kicks in and you start doing something in the game. That could lead to problems.
 
**Solution:**
Just set this new option. Now, if trigger interception condition is no longer met, the trigger will automatically deactivate itself. In our example, if I alt-tab out of game window, the whole functionality that is powered by `F3` will be deactivated. Note that you'll have to enable it back on again after you alt-tab back to the game. By having this option enabled you can make the overall system much more resistant to human errors.

# Image Capture Triggers UX improvements
Historically, when you were editing settings of Image Capture Triggers (Image/Text/Color/ML), Preview window was refreshing at exactly the same `Capture rate` that you had configured (or lower, if trigger was not able to reach that FPS). In most cases this is not really a problem, but as soon as for efficiency reasons you start working with very low FPS, such as trigger refreshing `1 time` in `10 second`, or even `0 FPS` triggers which are used in combination with [C# scripts](/en/scripting/getting-started) and [Behavior Trees](/en/behavior-trees/gettings-started). Previously, you had to manually click on `Refresh` button to force a redraw, which is not very convenient. Now, you can global app-wide minimum preview FPS, which will be used instead of Trigger Capture Rate. 

> Minimum Preview FPS will take effect only while you have Preview enabled! It won't affect FPS afterwards and won't be exported as part of a trigger configuration.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Fixed glitch which occurred on startup and made EventViewer display on top of the splash screen
- [Pack] Improvement in Packing - now packed versions won't react to "eyeauras://" links like the main version
- [UI] `Unload all`/`Load all` now affect Behavior Trees as well
