## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Scripting] Memory reading APIs are now case-insensitive by default
- [Scripting] Memory reading APIs - Added `ReadManaged<T>` which is slower than `Read<T>`, but respects `MarshalAs` and managed structures
- [Scripting] Memory reading APIs are now supporting both x86 and x64 as targets. Keep in mind that your own process is x64 anyways.
- [UI] Fixed a problem with new Folder Editor selection 
- [Crash] Fixed nasty crash in a new Folder editor
