# Script editor improvements
C# Script Action editor (only Action for now, editor in BTs/Triggers/Overlays is still the same) got some love:
- should popout much faster, usually takes ~1 second

- added Topmost button which could be used to make it so code editor will stay on top of other windows - very useful when editing something in real-time

- now popped out editor has EventLog similar to one that main app window has, but that log will contain only messages generated by the script. Should be easier to debug things

- fixed few bugs here and there

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Fixed a problem with C# Action being cancelled in some cases even if Ignore Cancellation is set.
