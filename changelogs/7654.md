# New feature - [Version History](/features/config-rollback)
Added a [Version History](/features/config-rollback) feature, allowing users to view and manage configuration snapshots saved over time. Users can now perform a Soft Reset to restore file states without altering history or a Hard Reset to fully revert to a specific commit, removing all changes made afterward.

p.s. RU version of the doc is availabel [here](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/ru/features/config-rollback)
