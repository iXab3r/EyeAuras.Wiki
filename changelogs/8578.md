# Overlapping Panels â€“ ~~Fixed!~~ Strike Back
In [8540](/en/changelogs/8540) I've tried to fix the problem displayed on the screen below - some of the panels in the program overlap and create unpleasant and glitchy effect. 
The problem, unfortunately, is not on EA side, but in one of the core frameworks that is developed by Microsoft. In February, they've posted that the bug is finally fixed, so I've tried to upgrade to that version and for the last couple of weeks we've all been testing their fix. 
As a result of that testing, I have to **rollback** the change - the new version fixed overlap problem, but introduced **3 new problems**:
- performance is noticeably worse 
- there are some issues with popping up windows(e.g. Login or Bindings editor)
- but the final nail to the coffin is a broken drag'n'drop - somehow MS managed to screw up one of the core UI functionalities and this is the one for which I could not find any workaround - in EyeAuras drag'n'drop is a core functionality used in Behavior Trees and Macros.

So, **for now**, the airspace issue is **back**. I'll keep monitoring the situation.
