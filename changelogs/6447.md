# Major code editor improvements - quick fixes, errors highlighting, tooltips, signature help, etc

**A lot** of improvements in how code editor looks and what it can do. 

### Error highlighting

Now whenever some error is encountered in a script, there will be a special markup showing that something is wrong in the code with detailed description of an error. Note that it is reflected on both the scrollbar and the codemap as well.

### Errors Quick fixes

If there is some well-known way to resolve an error, such as adding an additional import (**using …**), there will be a special button shown in the popup called “**Quick Fix…**”, click on it and the program will give you one or multiple potential quick fixes. The names are not very human-readable at the moment and I'll work on that in one of future versions

### Code completion improvements

Prototype of documentation pane which will be showing XML docs right next to method/property name. Currently in very alpha-rough stage, no markup, no highlighting, etc. What will be tested in following weeks is that mechanism for preparing these is working

Added on-hover tooltip
