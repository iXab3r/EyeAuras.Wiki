# C# Scripting - sneak peak into live import
You may have noticed that for the last 3-4 weeks number of changes has been lower than usual. The primary reason is me focusing on a new feature - live import in C# scripts, which will allow you to use full-blown IDEs such as Visual Studio and Rider for editing scripts.
For smaller scripts this is not that important, but for larger projects it is hard to overestimate quality of life that IDEs bring to the table.

In one of the following weeks this will be available for public testing, need some time to polish things.
Also, as a part of scripting subsystem improvements, there were some changes done in the engine, which now allow you to use NuGets which rely on native libraries, such as [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - a lot of programmers out there have experience with it an now you can leverage that knowledge and create ImGui overlays straight from the code.

This is an example of a live clickable ImGui overlay, which can contain any kind of data you want, running inside EA and being able to leverage _any_ functionality - computer vision, neural networks, memory read, input emulation - anything.
