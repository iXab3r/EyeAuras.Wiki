# New Release — 1.9 [RU](/ru/changelogs/9109)/[EN](/en/changelogs/9109)

Major changes to scripting and the available APIs, a switch to a new monetization model, and a lot more.

## Monetization changes — Free becomes Pro

**All** limitations that existed in the **Free** version are removed — no more limits on the number of auras, script size, Telegram integration, etc.

p.s. A license is still required for sending [network messages](/actions/send-network-message), but this restriction will be removed soon as well once I sort out a few technical details — most likely by the next release.

### So… no license needed anymore?

**Yes.** Everything that used to be locked behind a license is now available to everyone. In the very near future, the purchase options will be removed from the website.

### Why?

With the development of [sublicenses](/features/sublicenses) and [mini-apps](https://eyeauras.net/share/S20251105201607zPUUkZryl4CY), it feels right to shift the focus toward monetizing finished products built on top of the platform — while making the platform itself free. The entire foundation accumulated over 6 years of development is now available to everyone, and I hope this will nudge creators who were previously on the fence: “is it even worth trying to build something?”

Going forward, development will focus on making it easier to add modules to the app — for example, specialized input simulators useful for a specific game, or ready-to-use mini-apps that solve practical problems. All of this is already possible today, but the information is scarce and scattered. That will be fixed.

### But I bought a license just недавно — can I get a refund?

[Message me](/contacts) privately — I’ll try to help you out with this inconvenience.

## Under the hood

Over the last 3 months, more than 180 changes have been made to the app, but most of them were done in parts of the system that are not

# C# Scripting — [Embedded Resources](/scripting/embedded-resources)

A very powerful feature has been added to scripts — you can now embed whole files directly into your script: images, videos, text, or even DLL/EXE files.
And then work with them right from the script — display them in the UI, load them into Triggers/Actions, or simply unpack them to disk for later use.
This is especially useful if you want to bundle a library that isn’t available on NuGet — now you can just attach the file to the script and tell the app to use it as a dependency.

Moreover, if you’re using [C# Script protection](/features/script-protection), these resources will also be encrypted as part of the script, protecting your work and copyright.

# C# Scripting — Variable improvements

Updates to the script variables system — the approach to handling exceptional situations has been slightly changed. The goal is to make scripting simpler for new users.

# C# Scripting — [IDE integration](/scripting/ide-integration)

![IDE](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/10/EyeAuras_gzfCRUFI9X.png)
Since last year, the app has had an IDE integration mode — effectively, it’s a way to write full-fledged programs while staying inside the EyeAuras infrastructure.
You can edit the script directly from JetBrains Rider / Visual Studio or any other IDE, including AI-based ones — for example [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) by Google. This makes writing even small scripts faster and easier, not to mention larger projects.

# Performance improvements

This version includes more than a dozen tweaks and optimizations aimed at faster load times and faster internal subsystems.

Testing based on an [ImGui](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/imgui/getting-started) bot that uses memory reading shows that it’s now possible to operate in the ~2k FPS range — **INCLUDING** the cost of memory reads and parsing all required game structures. Before the fixes, numbers were around 500 FPS.

**Please report any issues you run into!**

## Bugfixes/Improvements

- **[Crash]** Fixed a problem with the License window crashing on startup
- **[EyePad]** Recents are now ordered by date (desc)
- **[Scripting]** Added a new **“Open in IDE”** button, which allows editing the script in Rider/Visual Studio and seeing changes reflected in EyeAuras in real time — **[more here...]**(/scripting/ide-integration)
- **[Scripting]** Embedded Resources fixes — made the Script FileProvider more flexible (it now understands more path formats)
- **[Scripting]** Fixed a bug in Live Import — it should now properly detect changes in `.csproj`
- **[Scripting]** Improved script deallocation — even if a user script contains dangling references, EyeAuras will try to clean them up if the script is no longer running
- **[BehaviorTree]** Fixed an issue with circular references — it caused the UI to show connections that aren’t actually there
- **[BehaviorTree]** Added a new node — **SetVariable**. It’s still in a very early phase, but I decided to ship it early just to test it out
- **[BehaviorTree]** Improved BT performance
- **[SendInput]** Fixed an issue with the TetherScript driver — on some resolutions/DPI, mouse clicks would also slightly move the cursor (+-1px). One more thing: please make sure you’re using a compatible driver version so everything works as expected — **[HVDK 2.1](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2024/10/HVDK%20Standard%202.1.exe)**, more info on **[this](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/tetherscript)** page
