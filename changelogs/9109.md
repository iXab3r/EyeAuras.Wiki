# New Release — 1.9 [RU](/ru/changelogs/9109)/[EN](/en/changelogs/9109)

Major changes to scripting and the available APIs, a switch to a new monetization model, and a lot more.

# Monetization changes — Free becomes Pro

**All** limitations that existed in the **Free** version are removed — no more limits on the number of auras, script size, Telegram integration, etc.

p.s. A license is still required for sending [network messages](/en/actions/send-network-message), but this restriction will be removed soon as well once I sort out the technical details — most likely by the next release.

### So… no license needed anymore?

**Yes.** Everything that used to be locked behind a license is now available to everyone. In the very near future, the license purchase options will be removed from the website.

### Do I still need a connection to the program’s server?

For now — yes. This is tied to how the program protects its modules and, at the moment, it’s an integral part of the system. Over the coming year I’ll try to revisit this approach, but it will take time. At the very least, I need to implement a mechanism that allows using the program offline for at least a few months.

### Why?

With the development of [sublicenses](/features/sublicenses) and mini-apps (https://eyeauras.net/share/S20251105201607zPUUkZryl4CY), it feels right to shift the focus toward monetizing finished products built on top of the platform — while making the platform itself free. The entire foundation accumulated over 6 years of development is now available to everyone, and I hope this will nudge creators who were previously on the fence: “is it even worth trying to build something?”

Further development will focus on making it easier to add modules to the program — for example, specialized input simulators useful for a specific game, or ready-to-use mini-apps that solve practical tasks. All of this is already possible today, but the information is scarce and scattered. That will be fixed.

### But I bought a license only recently — can I get a refund?

[Message me](/contacts) privately — I’ll try to help you out with this inconvenience.

# What’s coming in 2026

* improving the user experience around publishing mini-apps and other scripts/aura packs
* Unreal-like Blueprints — this idea has been in the air for a long time, and I’m going to try it out on one of the bots we’re developing right now. The core idea is to merge the Aura system and Behavior Trees into a single whole, so that one tool (Blueprints) can solve very different kinds of tasks
* Sublicenses — the mechanism is already working, but right now many parts of it are manual; they need to be automated
* More documentation — one of the main issues with the program right now is that it has *too much* stuff in it; the feature set has been accumulating for years and isn’t always well documented. These days, when a lot of questions are answered via LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), the quality and volume of API documentation is a decisive factor. I’m planning to dedicate a few weeks exclusively to this — possibly bringing in a specialist

# C# Scripting — [Embedded Resources](/scripting/embedded-resources)

A very powerful mechanism has been added to scripts — you can now embed whole files directly into your script: images, video, text, or even DLL/EXE files.
And then work with them right from the script — display them in the UI, load them into Triggers/Actions, or simply unpack them to disk for later use.
This is especially useful if you want to bundle a library that isn’t available on NuGet — now it’s enough to attach the file to the script and specify that the program should use it as a dependency.

Moreover, if you’re using [C# Script protection](/features/script-protection), these resources will also be encrypted as part of the script, protecting your work and copyright.

# C# Scripting — Variable improvements

Updates to the script variables system — the approach to handling exceptional situations has been slightly changed. The goal is to make scripting simpler for new users.

# C# Scripting — [IDE integration](/scripting/ide-integration)

![IDE](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/10/EyeAuras_gzfCRUFI9X.png)
Since last year, the program has had an IDE integration mode — in practice, it’s a way to write full-fledged programs while staying inside the EyeAuras infrastructure.
You can edit the script directly from JetBrains Rider / Visual Studio or any other development environment, including AI-based ones — for example [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) by Google. This makes writing even small scripts faster and easier, not to mention larger projects.

# Performance improvements

This version includes more than a dozen tweaks and optimizations aimed at improving load times and speeding up internal subsystems.

Testing based on an [ImGui](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/imgui/getting-started) bot that uses memory reading shows that it’s now possible to operate in the ~2k FPS range — **INCLUDING** the cost of memory read operations and parsing all required game structures. Before the fixes, the numbers were around 500 FPS.

## Bugfixes/Improvements

* **[Crash]** Fixed a problem with the License window crashing on startup
* **[EyePad]** Recents are now ordered by date (desc)
* **[Scripting]** Added a new **“Open in IDE”** button, which allows editing the script in Rider/Visual Studio and seeing changes reflected in EyeAuras in real time — **[more here...]**(/scripting/ide-integration)
* **[Scripting]** Embedded Resources fixes — made the Script FileProvider more flexible (it now understands more path formats)
* **[Scripting]** Fixed a bug in Live Import — it should now properly detect changes in `.csproj`
* **[Scripting]** Improved script deallocation — even if a user script contains dangling references, EyeAuras will try to clean them up if the script is no longer running
* **[BehaviorTree]** Fixed an issue with circular references — it caused the UI to show connections that aren’t actually there
* **[BehaviorTree]** Added a new node — **SetVariable**. It’s still in a very early phase, but I decided to ship it early just to test it out
* **[BehaviorTree]** Improved BT performance
* **[SendInput]** Fixed an issue with the TetherScript driver — on some resolutions/DPI, mouse clicks would also slightly move the cursor (+-1px). One more thing: please make sure you’re using a compatible driver version so everything works as expected — **[HVDK 2.1](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2024/10/HVDK%20Standard%202.1.exe)**, more info on **[this](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/tetherscript)** page
