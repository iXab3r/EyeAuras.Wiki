- [BehaviorTree] Fixed a very nasty bug which lead to parts of the tree not being shown after certain sequences of actions
- [UI] Aura Tree sorting is now properly updated after rename
- [UI] A lot of changes in mechanism that is responsible for UI updates - may be buggy a bit at first, but will end up much more effective in the long term
- [UI] Fixed a bug with Enter handling in numerical fields
- [UI] Implemented prototype of mechanism which will allow to login via license key instead of username/password - should make things easier for new users
