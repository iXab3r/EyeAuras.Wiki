# Authentication improvements
First steps toward offline mode - added new option in Settings which allows the client to function without connectivity to the server, even if the client gets restarted. 
For now, this is just a few hours, but as soon as I will be sure that the system properly works, this will be extended to days.
This option will be removed in the future and will become default behavior of the client.
