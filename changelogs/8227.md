# Behavior Trees / Macros - Activation Conditions - Hotkeys
Previously, there was a single way to make Trees and Macros "tick" and "run" (correspondigly). 
If you wanted to make the tree run when/while some hotkey was pressed, you had to use a separate **Aura** with **HotkeyIsActive** trigger in it.
In the new version you can just add that same hotkey in the Tree/Macro straight away, reducing number of operations and complexity of configuration drastically.

## Interception conditions
In original [HotkeyIsActive](/en/triggers/hotkey-is-active) triggers, there is a functionality, which allows to restrict hotkeys to a specific window/application/etc. 

```
This mechanism is directly responsible for enabling/disabling hotkeys handling at any given moment. By adding one or multiple auras you can specify exact set of conditions, which must be met before Trigger will start doing anything.

For example, by linking Aura which has WindowIsActive in it, you will make Trigger react only to keys which were pressed while game window is active.
In more complex cases, you can link the trigger to some in-game condition, for example, you when you click RMB(part of HotkeyIsActive configuration) AND some powerful skill is off-cooldown(linked condition), instead of casting whatever is usually on RMB, you'll simulate key press of a button which casts that skill. A good example would be automating cast of Vaal Skills on Path of Exile - you have the usual version of a skill bound to some button which you spam and whenever Vaal version got enough souls, it will be automatically release without you having to remember about it.
```


In BTs, the equivalent will be adding Enabling Condition on the tree itself - just like you did it before. The hotkey will be intercepted only if Enabling Condition is met. We'll see how that approach goes - please send your feedback.


# New Node - Interrupter - MAJOR
![Interrupter](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/04/NVIDIA_Overlay_BcuNcFnybW7n2Urv.png)
Very important new node in BTs ecosystem - it allows to conditionally interrupt already running nodes. 
Usually, when some node is Running (like `Wait` or `Until Success`), there is no chance to other nodes in the tree to do anything - EyeAuras just waits for the node to complete its work. 
In contrast, Interrupter node, when executed, ALWAYS runs Condition(left) node, even if the Action(right) node is Running. Moreover, if Condition succeeds, instead of giving control to already Running Action, it will **interrupt** it from further activity.
This could be used to break long-running actions (e.g. `Wait`) or make some loop(like `Until Success`) stop on demand - the node is emmensely powerful given right conditions. 


# New Node - Check Key State
![CheckKeyState](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/04/NVIDIA_Overlay_67L6LKy6zYaefV30.png)
Very simple node, which checks the current state of the specific key. If it is pressed, the node returns Success. 

# New Node - Timeout
![Timeout](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/04/NVIDIA_Overlay_LXg2AmK4w4bs3N0w.png)
Another node which is expected to be paired with long-running nodes such as `Until Success` - it allows you to put a maximum time which you "allow" the child node to Run. The first combination of nodes which comes to mind is something like this:

![Timeout example](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/04/NVIDIA_Overlay_gCj7ndqTKvCAx2Yy.png)
By combining `Timeout -> Until Success -> Image Search` you basically tell the tree `Keep trying to find the image until you Succeed, but no longer than for 2 seconds`.
