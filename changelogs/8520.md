# Send Input - Usb2kbd rework
Usb2Kbd is hardware input emulator. It has been supported by EyeAuras since ~2021.
Now you can create your own for approximately `5$` - the only thing that is needed is small device from AliExpress/Amazon.
Here is the detailed step-by-step guide ([russian](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/ru/actions/sendinput/usb2kbd) / [english](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/usb2kbd)).

I've also improved technical part and reworked settings window for better user experience.
