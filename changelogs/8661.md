# Macros - Return/Break nodes
Adding two new nodes which should help to create better and smarter Macros!

## Return
Return node allows you to exit the macro whenever you want to, even right in the middle of some sequence of operations. 
E.g. if character has died it does not make much sense to continue running the main loop. 
Equivalent of `return` operation in C#

## Break
Break is more niche - it allows you to exit the current **scope** (not the macro!), e.g. if you're inside some `Repeat` loop, you can jump out of it if needed. 
Equivalent of `break` operation in C#

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [SendSequence] Added Random Offset (like in MouseMove nodes)
- [CheckIsActive] Fixed node not being properly redrawn
- [BehaviorTree] Fixed a major visual bug which sometimes removed multiple nodes from the tree instead of a selected one
