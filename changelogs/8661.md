# Macros - Return/Break nodes
Adding two new nodes which should help to create better and smarter Macros!

## Return
Return node allows you to exit the macro whenever you want to, even right in the middle of some sequence of operations. 
E.g. if character has died it does not make much sense to continue running the main loop. 
Equivalent of `return` operation in C#

## Break
Break is more niche - it allows you to exit the current **scope** (not the macro!), e.g. if you're inside some `Repeat` loop, you can jump out of it if needed. 
Equivalent of `break` operation in C#

## Behavior Tree / Macro
Added a whole bunch of articles about Behavior Tree / Macro nodes.
Note that **most** of these articles are available in both Russian and English.
- [IsActive](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/IsActive) - checks whether parent Tree/Macro is currently Active
- [Interrupter](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/Interrupter) - (advanced) node, that allows to break execution of Behavior Tree if some condition is met
- [Return](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/Return) - allows to stop the macro
- [Break](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/Break) - allows to Break from the loop or code block
- [MouseMove Abs](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/MouseMoveAbs) - moves cursor somewhere on the screen (or to _something_)
- [MouseMove Rel](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/MouseMoveRel) - moves cursor relatively to its current position
- [CheckKeyState](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/CheckKeyState) - checks whether some key is currently being held
- [KeyPress](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/KeyPress) - simulate keypresses
- [Send Text](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/SendText) - inputs text either via copy-pasting it or inputting each character individually


## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [SendSequence] Added Random Offset (like in MouseMove nodes)
- [CheckIsActive] Fixed node not being properly redrawn
- [BehaviorTree] Fixed a major visual bug which sometimes removed multiple nodes from the tree instead of a selected one
