- **[Image Effects]** Added new image effect - **Color Range Replacement**
  - This effect allows you to specify a color range and two values - replacement color for matching pixels and replacement color for non-matching. This allows you to greatly simplify recognition in many cases by removing variability from the image, for example, replace all shades of red on HP globe with some unique color, **Color Search** for this color, as a result **Similarity** will give you you HP percentage (roughly).

- **[Image Effects]** Added new image effect - **Denoise**
  - Removes noise from an image, do not have anything more to say about it. Kinda similar to **Gaussian blur**, but gives better results in some cases
