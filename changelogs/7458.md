# ImageSearch improvement - added "Include All Matches"
Added new option "Include All Matches" which is intended to be used for some corner-case scripting purposes. By default,
Image search finds best possible match and then tracks its movement - that way it can avoid scanning the whole image every frame. 
This new option disables all such optimizations and image is fully scanned on every tick. On a positive side - this gives you access to multiple candidates and their similarities. On negative - it destroys performance. 

To get access to all found objects, you can use `TemplateMatches` which is returned as a part of `ImageSearchTrigger.Refresh` result
```csharp
public interface IImageSearchDetectionResult : ICaptureTriggerDetectionResult
{
...

    /// <summary>
    /// Contains an array of all successful template matches and their bounds/similarity
    /// Will contain more than 1 element only if Include All Matches is enabled in ImageSearchTrigger
    /// </summary>
    public ImmutableArray<TemplateMatchResult> TemplateMatches { get; init; }

...
}
```

> This is extremely CPU-heavy task. On 1920x1080 you'll probably have at most 2-3 FPS to do a full scan. This is a huge contrast to ML search, which on the same resolution for the same task can give you up to 60 FPS, so if you really need to detect multiple instances of some object, I would highly recommend to look into training Yolo model and using it instead.
