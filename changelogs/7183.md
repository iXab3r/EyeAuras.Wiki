# New feature - server-side packing
From now on, any shared pack of auras could be downloaded as a separate portable application which can be running in parallel with the main EyeAuras. This should drastically reduce complexity of onboarding of new users - to them, your pack of auras will look just like a usual program, which they can download, unzip and run. This is especially powerful in combination with [Custom UI](/en/overlays/custom-ui) - you can basically create entirely new program and then distribute it as a portable app, which will have multiple layers of anti-cheat protection, almost dozen different input simulators, high-performance image capture and ML-capabilities. 

This is still in early stages and will be the recommended way of distributing your work to other users, even those who are already using a program themselves - portable format guarantees that the program will keep working even if the main version of EyeAuras was updated in some breaking way.
