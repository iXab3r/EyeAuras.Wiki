## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Improved security measures a bit - last activities cleanup should be more reliable now plus it will also cleanup anything related to parent folder from which EyeAuras is started
- [BehaviorTrees] When you're manually running node (from editor) execution will be automatically cancelled when main window is brough to foreground - just like with auras 
- [UI] Few minor bugfixes which were in the new aura selector
