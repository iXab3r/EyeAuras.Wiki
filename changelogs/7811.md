# C# script editor improvements - Pop Out
In C# action/trigger/overlay added new button which pops out code editor into separate window. Still allows you to edit the code and switch between auras simultaneously. 

Code editor will get a lot of love in the nearest months - finally the code base for all scripting-related parts of the problem is the same and uses latest scripting engine (v3)
