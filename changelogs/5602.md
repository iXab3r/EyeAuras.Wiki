### [Send Network Message](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/send-network-message) **Action** / [Network Message](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/network-message) **Trigger improvements**

Rolled out infrastructure changes which heavily affect performance of sending/retrieving network messages. They could be used for building a network of inter-connected **EyeAuras** instances which do something (remote control, multi-boxing, etc).

Now there are multiple hubs per region (RU/EU) and the system will try to pick up the one nearest to your physical location, which means that latency should drop drastically, especially for **RU/CIS**, which previously partially reused EU servers even for internal messages. Choose Hub closest to you and new routing rules will try to pick the exact server in that region with the best latency.

Please note that as with any infrastructure changes, there is a chance that something will break. If you'll notice that latency (perceived) has increased, or something is not working as you would expect it to - please shout out.

### Latency

Aside from deploying additional servers and configuring routing, I've made changes to how network messages are handled, this also should've affected overall latency in a positive way. You can now check what the latency was for each and every message right next to the timestamp. Latency is calculated using the local time of sender and recipient (in UTC, so timezone does not matter) so the value potentially could be not very precise if clocks are desynced.

My personal latency dropped from **~100ms** before server-side changes to **~20ms**.

### US-servers

From what I know, there are not a lot of US users right now, scaling the infrastructure to the US-region is more a question of financial viability, everything from the tech side is ready, so when the time will come, I'll add US-servers as well.

### Actions/Overlays/Triggers can now be Ignored

Each and every action/trigger/overlay could now be **Ignored**. This is controlled by a checkbox to the left of its name and, in general, will make it appear like the ignored entity just does not exist. For triggers, this will exclude them from all evaluations. For actions, it will ignore them even if the block of actions is executed. For overlays - close and unload an overlay.

This is especially useful when you're debugging or tuning something and want to disable part of the aura temporarily.

p.s. this change does not affect C# scripting
