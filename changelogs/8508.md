# ImGui integration [EN](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/imgui/getting-started) / [RU](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/ru/scripting/imgui/getting-started)
Started working on native integration with ImGui - this is alternative approach to script/UI creation in EyeAuras. This should be the simplest one for those who only recently started coding - yes, some boilerplate code is requires to get things started, but after that it is very easy to understand. And ChatGPT can greatly help you. 

Finally, it is possible to create truly 1-script mini-apps that incapsulate both UI and automation logic.
