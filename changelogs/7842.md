# Send Input - first latency improvements
This is the first batch of changes which are targeting to improve the overall input similation latency across all simulators. 
I'll provide some metrics laters.

## Exclusive Control - removed
This was an option which existed for many years and made it so while one specific operation is being executed (e.g. some long SendSequence), no other inputs are allowed.
Made sense while the primary operation mode for program was using Auras, Triggers and Actions. Nowadays, those are considered obsolete and much better tools have been created which allow to solve exactly same issue - BehaviorTrees and Macroses. By their nature, they **never** allow execution of multiple inputs at once. 

This could theoretically affect some old-old auras or specific use-cases, but supporting it further prevented me from doing some latency optimizations for all the rest 95% modern use-cases, so it had to be removed "for the greater good".

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Fixed crash related to BinaryThreshold effect
- [UI] Minor performance uplift - the app should start 3-5% faster
- [UI] Fixed MouseMove node position in Macro/BTs being reset under some conditions
- [UI] Migrated logs hosting to another cloud-provider, should be a bit faster
