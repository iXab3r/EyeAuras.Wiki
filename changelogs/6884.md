# Further website improvements
From now on, whenever you paste links to EyeAuras website (https://eyeauras.net/) or even to specific auras (https://eyeauras.net/share/S20240426185158EYI4GEqRm2vh),
a small preview will be shown. This applies to most modern messengers - Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc.

# Auras upload/download speed improvements
Whenever you export or import aura, small (JSON) and large (binary, images, models, etc) parts will be handled separately and downloaded from different locations.
For you, as end user, this would mean that 
- Import preview will open up and work much faster for larger aura packs
- Synchronization is more efficient - the program won't need to download the whole 100+mb aura pack to perform diff anymore
- and, the most important but not implemented yet, it will allow to solve the problem with Aura Library opening for ages. These changes will come later this month.

This should be especially noticeable by users who are connected to `EU Eye Hub`. Eventually, I'll also add separate file hub to RU region as well.
