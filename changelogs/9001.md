## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [SendInput] Fixed a problem with TetherScript driver - on some resolutions/DPI, mouse clicks also slightly moved the cursor (+-1px). Another thing to note - please ensure that you're using compatible version of the driver to ensure everything works as expected - [HVDK 2.1](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2024/10/HVDK%20Standard%202.1.exe), more info on [this](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/tetherscript) page
