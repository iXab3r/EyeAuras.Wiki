## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [SendInput] Fixed a problem with TetherScript driver - on some resolutions/DPI, mouse clicks also slightly moved the cursor (+-1px). Another thing to note - please ensure that you're using compatible version of the driver to ensure everything works as expected - HVDK 2.1 @ https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2024/10/HVDK Standard 2.1.exe as stated on [this](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/tetherscript) page
