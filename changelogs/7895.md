# C# Scripting - added ability to reference assemblies by path/name
For several months we've had the feature in scripts, which allows to reference nuget packages
```csharp
#r "nuget: Coroutine, 2.1.5"

Log.Info("Hello, World!"); //you can use Coroutine classes in that script
```

The support has not been extended and you can reference assemblies in 2 other ways now. 
Important! This method of referencing assemblies is available only inside `Script.csx` which is equivalent of your `Program.cs` in "normal" C#

### By assembly path - from file
Syntax is very similar. 

```csharp
#r "assemblyPath: D:\Work\EAExile\EAExileAgent.Shared.dll"

Log.Info("Hello, World!"); //you can use EAExileAgent classes in that script
```

### By assembly name
This method of referencing assemblies allows you to reference those assemblies which are either:
- already loaded by EyeAuras, but have not been included into default referenced assemblies list
- were loaded using `Assembly.Load` or via any other means, but they are already part of [AssemblyLoadContext](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.loader.assemblyloadcontext?view=net-9.0)/[AppDomain](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.appdomain?view=net-9.0)
- are in [GAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/gac)

Historically, EA referenced A LOT of assemblies by default, more than 300 assemblies. This allows users to save some type on pre-configuring these dependencies on each and every C# action/BT node/etc, but this is not a good way long-term. Gradually, I'll be de-linking more and more default assemblies and will include a better auto-completion techniques which would allow to easily include those libraries which are needed for your script. In the future, this will make upgrading the program easier for everyone

```csharp 
#r "assemblyName: Grpc.Net.Client"

Log.Info("Hello, World!"); //you can use Grpc.Net.Client classes in that script
```


## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Scripting] Fixed a problem with CancellationToken rewriter - it was handling optional arguments incorrectly in some cases
