### Bindings improvements
[Bindings | EyeAuras Wiki](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/bindings) are a mechanism that allows you to wire multiple properties of actions/triggers together. E.g. get coordinates of found image from [Image Search](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/images/image-search) and move mouse there via [Send Sequence](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/send-sequence)

I've fully rewritten **Bindings Editor**, which is where you configure this kind of stuff. It is much snappier, responsive and easier to work with.  

### CVATAAT improvements
A LOT of different improvements and fixes - performance, UX, bugs. Listing all seems like a waste of time. Try it yourself - [Getting Started | EyeAuras Wiki](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/CVATAAT/getting-started)  

I know that there are some successful use cases, so the tech is working and training via CVATAAT is definitely much easier than doing everything manually.  

#### **BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS**
- Fixed memory leak which happened under some circumstances when Image Effects were used
