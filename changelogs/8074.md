## Macro editor - node removal
Improved item removal UX and aligned it with other parts of the program

## Links 
Changed how `Enabling Conditions` and `References` in BTs and Macros look like:

P.S. Note the icon to the left of the path - by clicking on it, you will be taken to that specific item.


## Double-clicks in Macros
- `C# Script` node - when double clicked, code editor will be Maximized
- Nodes with `Links` in them - when double clicked, you will be taken to the **first** link in the list

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Fixed a crash which happened if invalid aura name was set
- [Scripting] Fixed(?) a problem with `LoginWidget` not working properly
- [UI] Fixed a problem with script messages being duplicated in `Event Log`
