### Custom UI Overlay
Dozens of different changes related to Custom UI and code editor. The most significant is the feature that allows you to open code editor in a separate window, which is much more convenient if you have mid-large project opened and much faster, because it will use its own processor core.
- added C# autocompletion
- major performance improvements
- code editor could now be opened in a separate window
- code editor is not loaded by default to improve overall responsiveness
- added new option - Enable browser hotkeys, which enables/disables standard hotkeys like F12, F5, etc.

### UI Performance improvements
All overlays and some popups (image effects editor, for example) are now rendered by a separate processor core which should make UI much more responsive. The migration to this tech is still in progress, but current results look very good.

### Self-Protection
Added few additional protective layers which should make detection by different anti-cheats harder. This affects application startup-time (especially when [Security Measures](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/securitymeasures) option is enabled), but should not affect runtime performance

### Bugfixes/Other
- Updated Telegram.Bot package to v19
- Network/Telegram messages are now printed in event log
- SendInput - fixed a bug with editor resetting to an incorrect mode (Keyboard rather than Mouse w/ Location)
- SendSequence - improved drag'n'drop support
