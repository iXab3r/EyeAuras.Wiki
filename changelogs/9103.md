## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Scripting] Improved NuGet packages resolution - should solve problem of baseline assemblies conflicting with packaged ones
- [Scripting] MemoryAPI - added `NativeLocalProcess` - very similar to `LocalProcess`, but uses a bit lower-level reading technique and allows to use handle to the process as a starting point
- [Scripting] MemoryAPI - added DLL injection via manual mapping - allows to avoid some detection vectors
