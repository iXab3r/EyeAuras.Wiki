# Major changes in authentication - preps for offline usage
Almost fully reworked part of the program which is responsible for pulling authentication data from the server. 
The intent is to eventually allow users to use the program without connection to the server. This is a multi-phase effort with internals rework being the first phase. 


## Window Selector improvements - added filter-properties
Window Selector is that control which allows you to pick/specify Target Window. For many years, it has been filtering-out all windows, which were under EA control. 
This is now an optional feature, which could be disabled by adding `[ownedBy=any]` to the [expression](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/features/window-matching-expressions), e.g.
`My Window [ownedBy=any]` 
will filter out and scan through ALL windows, which are present in the system, even if they were created by EyeAuras. 

Another filter of a similar type which was added allows to capture so-called Tool windows, e.g. Overlays usually have this type.
By default, such windows are ignored and can add them as potential candidates by appending `[type=any]` at the end of match expression, e.g.
`My Overlay [ownedBy=any][type=any]` 
would capture any window/overlay which has title `My Overlay`.


## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Capture] Fixed a problem where WGCS tried to capture the image before window is visible (Argument out of range)
- [Scripting] CodeEditor improvements - changed how errors are highlighter plus added single-file Razor template + updated the template itself
- [UI] Fixed effects counter #EA-753  Effects counter v7668 by Headway9016
- [UI] Fixed a problem with Export/Activation on the server-side
