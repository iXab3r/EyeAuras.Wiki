# C# Scripting - Embedded Resources - alpha
Added new very powerful tool into our toolkit - now you can embed arbitrary files, be it images, videos, text files or even DLL/EXE files right into your script.
And then, from that very script you can do whatever you want with them just like if they would be right there on the disk.
This opens up a lot of new possibilities - embedding guiding materials into scripts, bringing your own assemblies which contain some custom code or even entire installers of tools which your script might use.

Moreover, with use of [C# Script protection](/features/script-protection) it is possible to protect those resources with encryption, making it much harder to extract and re-use outside the script. I'll announce separately when that part of functionality will be publicly available.

# C# Scripting - Variables improvements
Improved EyeAuras resiliency around script variables management - now none of default methods (accessing variable value or listening for its changes) are throwing exceptions, making it easier for new users to pick up and use. 

General idea is to bring things closer to Python/JavaScript as usually in scripting you want as much flexibility as possible. 
At the same time, C# is strongly-typed language, thus striking the balance is not easy. This is the second iteration of variables, so we'll see how it goes.
