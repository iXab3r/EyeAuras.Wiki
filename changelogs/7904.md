# MouseMove - added Random offset
Added simple way of randomizing XY.
Together with Input Smoothing, this should make inputs appear more humane.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Added two new actions - `Execute Tree` and `Execute Macro` which could be called from Auras. This is a "glue" which allows to wire together two automation approaches which exist in EA
- [Scripting] Changed how assemblies are loaded - fixes a problem with transitive dependencies
- [Scripting] Exposed IPerformanceMetricsAddon - could be used to track performance of the app via scripting
- [Scripting] Changed script compilation order - fixes a problem with Razor sometimes not being compiled correctly
