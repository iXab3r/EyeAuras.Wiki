# Two new image effects
## Binary Threshold 
Very useful for analysis as it allows to split image to black and white which makes further checks much more simple.
E.g. instead of having red HP bar with a lot of shades, you can convert it to black/white image where white is filled area of the bar.


## Color Quantization
Another image simplification technique, allows to reduce total number of colors in the image. By itself it is mostly useless, but can help in combination with other effects.


## Bugfixes/Improvements

Made is to IsMaximized in ExecuteScriptNode is stored in the node itself
- [MLSearch] If model has invalid format - meaningful error will be shown
- [UI] If Check for Updates is disabled, app will not do it during startup anymore
- [ImageSearch] Made it so `Load from preview pane` avoids copying debug data
