# [KeyLogin](/features/keylogin)
[KeyLogin](/features/keylogin) is system which is intended to be used along with [Sublicenses](/features/sublicenses) to allow **your** users to access your cool [Packs](/features/packs) as quickly as humanly possible. 

That is how the process looks **right now**

For end-user(the person who will be **using** the pack):
- purchase a key to **your** pack from a 3rd party website
- go to pack page, click on `Download pack`
- login via the key and start using the pack

I think this is as simple as it could get and we'll stay in that state for some time and see how it goes.

For you(author, who is **creating** the pack):
- you create something cool
- you export it and get URL (like [this](https://eu.eyeauras.net/share/S202503032233289fPxqP4AA0N0) or [this](https://eu.eyeauras.net/share/S202501090436317xjW3IVh0e4L) or other packs in [Aura Library](https://eu.eyeauras.net/library))
- add description, images, etc to the page
- add an aura which checks for the license - code is available for copy-paste
- enable [Script Protection](/features/script-protection) - this makes it much-much harder to counteract licensing mechanism
- contact me(Xab3r) in Discord and I generate keys for you
- **you(user)** distribute keys via FunPay or any other websites that allow to sell keys 

Yeah... for authors the process is not as straightforward. I try to streamline it this year.
