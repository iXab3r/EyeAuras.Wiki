### New release!

Here is an aggregated list of changes that were done in the program in the **last 4 months**.Â 

There has been a lot of work done - better C# scripting (for Triggers/Actions and Overlays), better Send Sequence (which now fully replaces Send Input in functionality), improved configuration subsystem, much faster and efficient Image Effects (which can now downscale images for better performance) and a bunch of other stuff.

Also, to accommodate to new and extremely quickly growing Machine learning community, I've developed a separate application to make it easier to create and train Yolo models, which are fully supported by the ML Search feature. From my experience that is much faster than prepare the data manually, even considering that this app is still in early alpha stage. For more information, visit: [Getting Started | EyeAuras Wiki](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/CVATAAT/getting-started).

#### User Interface Technology Transition

A major ongoing initiative is the transition to a new UI technology. This change is aimed at resolving current issues with the software's responsiveness, such as when switching auras or creating new triggers/actions. While this transition is a slow process, potentially taking an additional **6-12 months**, the anticipated outcome promises significant improvements. This can already be seen in the newly improved **Import/Export** and **Bindings** dialogs, which are now utilizing this technology. Throughout following months you will be seeing how different parts of application are replaced and rewritten, one-by-one (aura tree, I am looking at you).

#### What is next?

**Performance:** major focus in the next update - I've fully revamped configuration system, this is currently in testing and should make the app load and operate much faster, especially on lower-end PCs. Also, as I've mentioned, I will rewrite slower parts of the app like aura tree to make user experience better.

**Behaviour Trees**: Currently under development and testing, Behaviour Trees are the next major feature to look forward to. They are basically a full revamp of how you work with the app. Also, they are using the new UI tech, so much-much more responsive :)

Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your continued support and use of the software!

### New Features and Enhancements

**Send Sequence 2.0**: Combines all types of actions for enhanced input sequences.

**New C# Scripting Engine**: Now available in Triggers/Actions (alpha stage), enhancing the capabilities with new and improved [APIs](https://docs.eyeauras.net/)

**Bindings Improvements**: Rewritten Bindings Editor for better performance and usability. Much-much-much more responsive and versatile

**Enhanced Scripting with Visual Studio/Rider Compatibility**: Export and save your code as a C# project for more advanced development features.

**Import/Export Dialogs Rework**: More responsive, detailed, and user-friendly. Awaiting synchronization dialog updates in one of nearest updates

### Performance and Usability Enhancements

**Network Message Improvements**: Infrastructure changes for better performance and reduced latency.

**Custom UI Overlay and UI Performance**: Significant changes for better performance and responsiveness.

**General Performance Improvements**: Focused on enhancing the user experience and software responsiveness.

**Aura Tree Responsiveness**: Improvements to the Aura Tree interface for smoother interaction.

### Other Improvements

**Image Scaling in Rescale Image Effect**: Now supports scaling by both X and Y axes. Also you can now downscale the image using Effects, gain some performance and the app will be still able to calculate valid coordinates of found image and click on it! That works for ALL types of triggers (ML, Color, Image)

**New Image Effects**: Introduction of Color Range Replacement and Denoise effects for better image analysis.

**ML Search Enhancements**: Major performance improvements and new features in ML Search. This goes more for scripting as only they open up full ML potential.
