# 1.7 Day one patch
Following the feedback, this patch fixes a problem which was found in auto-update system - with `Security Measures` option enabled, the app was not updating properly and reverted to the previous version upon restart.

Unfortunately, for obvious reasons I cannot just release an update which will fix that. There are two solutions:
1) Temporarily disable `Security Measures` in `Settings`, update the app and enable it again.
2) Go to https://eyeauras.net/download, download the installer and run it. Do not worry, all your settings will be intact.

Please keep reporting found problems!

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Fixed auto-update, which should now properly work for all 4 modes of operation (standalone, portable and security measures turned on/off)
