## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Scripting] Changed how buttons behave when editor gets resized - now it is much easier to have small floating panel with the script somewhere on the screen, while you're editing the code in IDE
- [Scripting] Editor performance tweaked - should switch between files faster
- [Scripting] Added Restart button which... well, restarts the script. More convenient than stop-starting every time. Keep in mind that this is NOT needed in C# Overlays - they operate in always-live mode by default.
