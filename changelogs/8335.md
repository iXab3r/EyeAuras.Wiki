# BTs/Macros - Performance bugfix
In one of the latest changes in 1.6 I've introduced a bug, which made switching between BTs/Macros excruciatingly slow in some cases. Especially if you had multiple macros with a large number of nodes in them. 

This patch fixes this. I'll be closely monitoring the situation. 

Please report any kind of UI slowness you notice.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [UI] Fixed vertical scrollbar in Macros
- [BehaviorTrees] Optimized BTs load times 
- [BehaviorTrees] Fixed non-critical(recoverable) crash which happened if you quickly switch between multiple BTs/Macros
- [Scripting] Optimized dependency resolution - should consume less memory and be overall faster 
- [Packs] Made is so CheckForUpdates is now disabled by default in Packs. You(author) can still enable it if needed.
- [BehaviorTrees] Added IEnumerator<NodeStatus> support in BTs - will prepare an example later today.
