Implemented prototype of **Event Log** - in-built viewer that shows which auras have been activated/deactivated recently and which actions were executed. In combination with **Dependencies Viewer overlay** it should help you to find that nasty “rogue” aura which keeps pressing some button when you do not want it to.  
Eventually this thing will hold other information as well - warnings, errors, information about latest updates, etc.
