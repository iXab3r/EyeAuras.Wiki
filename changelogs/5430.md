### Actions can now be enabled/disabled
Any action in Auras can now be disabled temporarily by clicking on a checkbox right next to its name. This can be helpful for debugging purposes and is also exposed to access via **scripting system**, so you can toggle which actions will be executed if the user selected some set of options in your [**Custom UI**](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/custom-ui) / configuration file / etc

### Aaaan another pack of Anchors System changes
In [5397](https://eyeauras.net/download/?v=1.3.5397) I've already done some changes in how anchors in different screens of EyeAuras work, but that was not enough to cover some cases, i.e. clicking on the center of an image found by [**Image Search**](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/images/image-search)

So, now we have **two** different types of Anchors - **Position** and **Content.** This should provide extra flexibility to the system, but also may add some confusion. 

Rule of thumb is the following:

- If you want to calculate coordinates of a point(i.e. X and Y), in most cases you'll have to use **Content** anchor. [**SendInput**](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/send-input) clicking on the center of an image found by [**Image Search**](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/images/image-search) is the best example in this case.
- If you want to position rectangle in relation to another rectangle (X, Y, Width, Height) - you should look into **Position** anchor. This is useful when you want to build a “panel” of sorts, e.g. put multiple overlays showing cooldowns right next to each other. By using anchors you can avoid specifying the coordinates of each overlay and can use [**Bindings**](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/bindings) to make the whole panel movable as a single overlay

More details and examples can be found at [https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/coordinate-system](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/coordinate-system)

### BUGFIXES / IMPROVEMENTS
- Fixed an issue with **Public** Auras becoming **Unlisted** after updating the pack in [Aura Library](https://eyeauras.net/library)
- **Aura Variables** pane should be now visible again, it was accidentally hidden from the main screen
- Fixed a problem with [**Bindings**](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/bindings) in [**SendInput**](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/send-input) - they were temporarily disabled some time ago and now they are back to business. So, the combination of keys is now configurable via config/script again.
- Fixed an issue with invalid coordinates being resolved in **Send Input** when some aura was **Linked**
- **C# Script** compilation speed improvements
