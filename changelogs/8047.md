# C# Scripting - NuGet packing
Using [NuGet packages](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/nuget) in scripts opens up a lot of new possibilities and is hard to underestimate its importance. 
But [downloading](https://www.nuget.org/) and unpacking packages takes time - not much, but noticeable for end-user. 
From now on, when you're downloading any Pack, EyeAuras server will analyze your code and pre-download all needed packages. 

This benefits:
- startup speed - because all nuget packages are included by default into pack
- stability - because even if something will happen with that specific version of NuGet package that you've used OR there are some Internet problems, your downloaded pack will still work just fine

> That change IS NOT retroactive - it will affect only `new` revisions of packs.
