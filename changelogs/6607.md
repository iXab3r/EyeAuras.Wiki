# Scripting/tuning/bugfixes
This release contains mostly different improvements and bugfixes from the first week of Behavior Trees being public and people starting doing some scripting in it.

## On-screen-display - added Window and Region visualization
In all triggers of a Search family, new option is added which highlights on the screen the window that is being captured as well as the region inside window (if set) that is processed. This helps during debugging/configuration process a lot. Also ALL OSD checkboxes are [bindable](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/bindings) so you can very easily throw-in some [HotkeyIsActive](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/hotkey-is-active) trigger, bind all checkboxes to its `IsActive` property and voila - you have toggleable overlay with all bounding boxes/regions/labels right on your screen.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Image/Color/ML Search] Now videos that you save can be encoded by **H.264** codec which provides a much better quality giving you better training materials
- [Image/Color/ML Search] Fixed a bug in all *Search triggers with region not being correctly selected when anchor/offset is set
- [ML Search] Fixed a bug - "Show more" was not working
- [UI] Removed window transitions - these should speed up opening dialog windows a bit
- [Crash] Fixed rare crash that sometimes occured when the program tried to acquire title of removed process 
- [Scripting] Exposed **ViewportTransforms** in all capture triggers - this could be used to transform game coordinates to screen coordinates and vice versa. Very useful if you want to draw an overlay using **IOnScreenCanvasScriptingApi** or click on in-game object using **ISendInputUnstableScriptingApi**.
- [Scripting] Added support of relative path `.` which will return the aura/folder where the script is running. Refer to [this example](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/basic/find-aura) to get better understanding of what I am talking about
- [Scripting] Added IsKeyDown/IsMouseDown to [ISendInputUnstableScriptingApi](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/api/ISendInputUnstableScriptingApi) - these methods allow to find out whether keyboard key or mouse button are currently pressed or not
- [[YoloEase](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/YoloEase/getting-started)] Extracted this tool to a separate [Github project](https://github.com/iXab3r/YoloEase). Sources will be added a bit later. To those who missed it - this tool allows you to automate process of training machine-learning models by doing most of the work itself. All you have to do is feed it screenshots and labeled data.
