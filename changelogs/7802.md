# Early-early prototype - C# Overlay v3
Added new type of Overlay, which uses the latest version of EyeAuras scripting engine - same one, that is used in C# Actions/Triggers and BehaviorTrees. 
For the next few weeks old C# overlay and new one wil co-exist. As soon as I will releat Export/Import functionality, old one will go away as it is worse in everything - performance, flexibility, etc. 

Aside from scripting engine changes, this new overlay is using recently added Blazor Windows, which should make overlays more responsive and just in general more pleasant to work/interact with.

IMPORTANT! The overlay is far from being completed - there are still a lot of rough edges which I will work on in the following weeks.
