# C# Scripting - DLL injection
For the last couple of months I've been working on internal improvements of `EyeAuras.Memory` namespace. The goal is to extend capabilities and to support 
DLL injection and hooking of external processes.
For now, I am releasing only one bit of the entire set of improvements - `LocalProcess` now has `InjectDll` method which uses naive [CreateRemoteThread](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread) based injection. 
**This will not help with kernel anti-cheat protected projects**. We're already testing kernel-driver based solution which allows to counteract that inconvenience - I'll keep you posted. 

DLL injection brings a lot of interesting and powerful things to the table - the topic is very niche and technical, but in the next 6-12 months I'll be trying to make it accessible to anyone with some C# skills, without deep understanding of internals.
