- Fixed changelogs - for the last few weeks they were not displaying correctly
- [**ImageSearch**] Added two new properties which are bindable
  - Rectangle **Bounds** - contains bounding box of the last found image offset by search Region
  - Rectangle **BoundsOnScreen** - **Bounds** but offset by screen window position as well. This makes this property an ideal candidate for binding **Overlays** to it - no extra conversion needed any more (relative => absolute)
- [**Bindings**] Added few improvements, e.g. it is now possible to bind properties of type **Point (X, Y)** to **Rectangle,** which makes it easier to create offsets / search image-in-image /etc
