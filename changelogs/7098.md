# Scripting improvements
## Made it possible to write custom mouse input smoother - [more on this](/en/scripting/examples/advanced/custom-input-smoother)
Input smoothers are used to make mouse movement appear.... well... smooth. There are many-many different algorithms out there and EyeAuras currently incorporates only two of them. 
In this version I've made it possible to implement custom smoother via scripts and then use it wherever you want to - in behavior trees, in auras, in other scripts. 
The next thing I am planning to allow to do is implement an entire input simulator in the code - that way you can implement input method which will be able to send inputs to background window, for example. I want to add one myself but new things keep popping up and by adding this I will unblock those who can code it themselves.


## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Capture] Restored bit of lost functionality that allowed to capture entire screen, for now I made it available only in `CopyFromScreen` method, will extend to more performant methods a bit later
- [Pack] Fixed bug in Packing algorithm related to creating new directory
