- [Feature] Added new input method - TetherScript, which requires [ControlMyJoystick](https://tetherscript.com/controlmyjoystick-download/) software to be installed (Free version is enough). It is still early alpha, so please send reports if something works incorrectly
- [Feature] Enabled ImageEffects for all users - it was in testing phase for a few months and should be stable enough for most uses. There will be a separate video/wiki article about effects soon
