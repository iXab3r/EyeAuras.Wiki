## **True alpha**

The last three weeks have been fruitful as I've made numerous improvements, primarily in performance. Launch times, memory usage at startup and during operation, CPU and GPU usage for search, and configuration handling efficiency have all been enhanced. In some areas, there's been a performance increase of tens of percent. Equally important, several subsystems have been added that will allow me to more effectively identify and address problem areas in the future.

Currently, there are two noticeable issues - memory consumption at startup (ranging from **1 to 2 GB**, but drops to **500 MB** after a while) and the overall responsiveness of the interface. The causes of both are understood, but as there's no quick and painless fix, we'll be gradually moving towards solutions over the next six months.

## **New Input Type - Granny's Send Input**

Nothing extraordinary, just another method of input. It's useful only if other methods are not working for some reason.

## **Alpha Testing of New Subsystems**

Three new options have been added (Properties Caching, File System Storage, and File References), which can be enabled in Settings. All are aimed at improving performance in various ways. These options are still in the testing phase, so be prepared for potential issues if you decide to enable them, or wait until the systems are officially released and enabled by default. Your participation and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

## **BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS**

- Fixed a rare crash during import (ReplaceId NullReferenceException).
- [UI] Completely rewritten secondary panel with log and variables.
- [UI] All windows and overlays now open faster.
- [UI] Import dialog can now perform Synchronization as well
- [Synchronization] Fixed a bug that caused the program to crash if synchronization was added inside a folder that was already synchronized.
- [Scripts] Numerous improvements in the scripting subsystem - it's now faster and more memory-efficient.
- [Scripts] ImageSharp library added to the SDK. In some aspects, it's more convenient than OpenCV, and likely, future APIs will be built around it.
- Improved accuracy of all waits and delays, now with a margin of error within 1ms.
