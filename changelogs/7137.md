# Behavior Tree UI changes
- Made the panel with nodes collapsible + changed how nodes look (they take much less space now)
- Fixed problems with some nodes icons not being shown properly
- Improved UX when operating with many(>3) BTs simultaneously


# Added "About" aka Credits 
EyeAuras includes almost two hundreds of libraries covering different parts of its functionality and I want to give credits to authors.
