# Screen capture - *BREAKING CHANGE*
For years, `Target Window` was a prerequisite in all `Capture` triggers (Image/Color/Text/ML) - EyeAuras worked only with windows. 
Starting from this version, we'll try a different approach:
- **If `Target Window` is not set, EA will start capturing Primary Screen**

## What this means in practice?
- previously, clearing `Target Window` basically stopped Triggers from working. From now on, this will only switch the mode to Primary Screen capture and I would suggest to use [Enabling Conditions](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/features/enabling-conditions) to control the capture. This is very important! **Check your old triggers to ensure that there are no "test" or "leftover" triggers as they will start eating up CPU.**
- minus extra step if you're setting up something for a personal use - setting up `Target Window` in many cases is not really required if you're playing games in `Borderless Windowed` or other similar modes where the game occupies the entire screen
- as soon as we remove window-related stuff from the picture, working with mouse coordinates becomes more simple - [every coordinate becomes absolute](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/features/coordinate-system)
- everything related to clicking on objects on the screen will continue to work as is. If you'll notice some problems - please report



> IMPORTANT! Multi-monitor setups are not supported yet. Only the primary screen will be captured. I'll extend support in the future

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Capture] Fixed a problem with FPS selector - it was not working properly and was showing Range selector even if "Min" option was not set
