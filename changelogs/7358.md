# Yolo 10 support
Implemented test support for machine-learning models based on [Yolo 10](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov10/) which is bleeding edge tech for real-time object detection.

# New release of YoloEase
YoloEase is an open-source automation tool which speeds up the process of getting good-enough models. 
Recently I've updated it to include a bunch of new features such as Yolo10, per-label filtering and few others

# SubTree-as-a-node
New functionality in Behavior Trees - you can now mark sub-trees as Shared. This will allow you to create nodes pointing to that specific sub-tree right from the toolbar.
