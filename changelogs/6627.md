## Execute Aura Action/Node - added execution strategy
[Execute Aura](/en/behavior-trees/nodes/execute-aura) node and action have received a minor improvement - now you can choose how to execute linked actions, in order or randomly pick one of them. The latter could be used, for example, to randomly pick one of teleports to a spot to make actions of your bot less predictable.
