### New trigger - [Volume Level](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/volume-level)

This trigger allows you to configure reaction to loud sounds (or presence of sound at all) by setting volume level threshold (will be in decibels eventually, currently it's a decimal number [-1;1]

- How it works?
  - It allows you to select specific audio device (input/output), captures audio and measures Min/Max/Average value of played audio samples. In most cases analysis in done in 50ms "frames". If peak value in some frame is high enough ( â‰¥ **Min Level**) then the trigger is switched on. As soon as peak level decreases it automatically switches off.

- Is it able to detect a specific sound like click, footsteps or alarm?  
  - No, this requires some fancy algorithms which I do not have time to research/implement atm. Maybe at some point in the future if demand will be high enough.

- Is it able to capture audio output of a specific application?
  - No, API that I am using does not support this feature. If you are interested - ping me in Discord with your use case description and I'll think about switching to another one if there will be enough requests and it will be more useful than other features on the roadmap.
