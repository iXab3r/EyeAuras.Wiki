# Performance - startup time improvements
Started to work on startup time improvements and, more specifically, "cold" (first) start. 

Here are startup times for the latest pack for GTA5 by `@linx` - https://eyeauras.net/share/S202503032233289fPxqP4AA0N0
**v8215** - `33.41s`
**v8224** - `28.89s`

So the new version is approximately `15%` faster on the first launch.

Subsequent launches:
**v8215** - `29.38s`
**v8224** - `27.10s`
`~8%` faster.

I will keep working on improving those stats.
