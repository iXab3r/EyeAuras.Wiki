## **BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS**
- [**Bugfix**] Fixed bug that would crash UI when items were reordered
- [**Bugfix**] Fixed bug in [**Replica**](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/replica) overlays - **Keep Aspect Ratio** was not properly calculating width/height of the overlay when source was resized
- [**UI**] When aura has only **1** action/trigger/overlay, the editor for that item will be expanded to occupy all available space. This should make working with such auras much more pleasant experience, especially after I'll adapt all editors to benefit from that change.
