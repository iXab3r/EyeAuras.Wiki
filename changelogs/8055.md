# Packing - added Start Minimized and Minimize To Tray

Added two new options in Packaging. Both of them are indended to be used by setups with custom scripts having their own UI.
By leveraging [Lifecycle Events trigger](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/lifecycle-events) and C# script creating a custom Blazor Window, you can make it so **YOUR** user interface will be shown instead of EyeAuras.

## Start Minimized
If set, when the app gets fully loaded, main window will be minimized.

## Minimize To Tray
If set, the window won't even be displayed on the Taskbar, leaving only your custom window there.

# C# Scripting - LoginWidget
Added two new examples which use BlazorWindows - [Basic Window](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/advanced/basic-window) and [Custom Login](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/advanced/window-login-widget).
Login Widget allows to very easily integrate EyeAuras authentication into your app. It will get more customizable and extensible when I'll receive first feedback.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [BlazorWindows] Fixed a problem with Transparent background - if set, the window would become unclickable
