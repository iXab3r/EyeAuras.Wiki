# Overlapping panels - fixed!
Putting this in separate section as probably all users of EA at one point of another seen that problem - you resize one of the panels and it starts overlapping with another, the most usual scenario is C# Action overlapping with Event Log.
This bug is known [WPF Airspace issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/dwayneneed/mitigating-airspace-issues-in-wpf-applications) and was known for at least **12 years**. Specifically in the Microsoft UI framework that EyeAuras uses, it has been there since **July 2020**[https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Feedback/issues/356]

Ano now, finally, after _years_ of waiting, this has been fixed by Microsoft. Yey. Unfortunately, this has been one of those issues which are very hard to fix on application-side, so I had to just wait.

## Why it matters?
This fix is important not only because now UI is more convenient to use on lower resolutions, but also it was a huge roadblock on migration of triggers/actions to a new UI framework. Before that the only viable approach was rewriting ALL of the triggers and actions in one go, I could not work on them on a 1-by-1 basis. As you can imagine, this is not really doable - full rewrite would take months of writing the code which nobody uses and then putting it all at once. Number of bugs would be stunning. 

And now, I can start rewriting triggers/actions gradually. Rework will still take months, but it is doable. 

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Scripting] IMemory -> `ReadExports` now returns human-readable version of export alongside with original name, e.g. `?StaticClass@UGameEngine@@SAPAVUClass@@XZ` -> `public: static class UClass * __cdecl UGameEngine::StaticClass(void)`
