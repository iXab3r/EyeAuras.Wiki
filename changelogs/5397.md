## Main Focus
In **June**, the main focus was on script improvements. Most of the results of this work will be available in **August** - behavior trees, pathfinding, visualization. I am actively working on a project related to **Diablo 4** which will combine most features of **EyeAuras** together just to prove how capable it is in its current state, so most of the systems I am implementing for a bot will be available to all users as soon as their **API** will be stabilized. I will write a detailed post as soon as they will be ready for public use. Feel free to contact me directly if you want to try out some of them earlier than others.  

## Wiki updates
A lot of changes in **Wiki** - [https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/home](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/home)
- Added information for all (almost) types of actions/triggers and overlays available in the program
- Added info about **Coordinate System** which is used in some actions/triggers to define capture region, clone region or click coordinates: [https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/coordinate-system](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/coordinate-system)
- Added info on **Text Match Expressions** which are used to evaluate recognized text or received network/telegram message: [https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/text-match-expressions](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/text-match-expressions)
- Added info on **Window Match Expressions** which are used to specify the window that should be picked as Target Window: [https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/window-matching-expressions](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/window-matching-expressions)
- Take a peek at **Dependencies Viewer**, which is very often overlooked and allows to very easily debug a complex set of auras: [https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/dependencies-viewer](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/dependencies-viewer)
- Added some technical information about **Custom UI**: [https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/custom-ui](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/custom-ui)
- Bindings: an immensely powerful mechanism that allows binding properties of triggers/actions together - [Bindings | EyeAuras Wiki](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/bindings)
  - you can find inventory using Image Search and bind the found region as a source region for another image search which will now search only in the inventory area
  - bind coordinates of an overlay to Image/Text/Color Search, link Overlay's Locked status to HotkeyIsActive and now the user is able to quickly change the capture zone by clicking on a hotkey and dragging the overlay somewhere on the screen
- Synchronization: a mechanism that allows more easily sharing a set of auras which you're constantly working on

## Anchors System Improvements *BREAKING CHANGE*
Anchors are a coordinate system used everywhere where you need to select an area of something - screen, image, etc.  
The idea is that by specifying different reference points, you can easily align capture or output zones relative to each other.  
More details and examples can be found at [https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/coordinate-system](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/coordinate-system)

## Input Redirect Improvements
A rather niche feature available in the Settings that allows you to redirect all user input through a specific simulator.
- A quick enable/disable redirection from the main window, this mode is available if a simulator for redirection is set in the settings

## ML Search Improvements
- In the **Effects** window, you can now set up automatic screenshot capture/recording, which helps a lot in collecting a dataset for training

- Performance improvements, should be noticeable especially in **CPU** mode
- Fixed a crash related to incompatible/broken model loading
- Fixed memory leak which occurred in **Segmentation** mode
- Improvements to **Segmentation** and masks - a new mode “Group Masks by Class” has been introduced that allows you to glue all masks of one class into one, thereby greatly simplifying their processing.
  - e.g. neural network detected 6 different areas marked as “Road”. If you select "group by class", all binary masks will be combined together into 1 “Road” as well as their bounding boxes
  - **Segmentation** is a process of capturing not only bounding boxes of objects but their exact form as well

## BUGFIXES / IMPROVEMENTS
- Mouse capture improvements - less latency
- Status display added
- '**New replica**' button removed. Now to create a replica, you need to go: **New Aura -> Overlays -> Replica** and specify the region for capture/replication
- Startup speed optimizations
- Drag'n'Drop should be more responsive
- Fixed an issue in **AuraTree** related to abrupt jerks when scrolling/selecting elements
