## Changed auto-update download source

Previously, updates for the program were downloaded from Microsoft Azure cloud, the expectation was that due to vast infrastructure capabilities, download speed will be great in all regions, but… it ended up being worse than from a single server in Saint-Petersburg. 

Since this update, the program will download its updates from one of multiple servers located in Frankfurt, Germany, which is a major hub and this should give most users at least “good enough” download speed. We'll see how it goes and maybe I'll scale up that same approach and use multi-regional hosting as well. The current system allows me to fully control from which exact server the download will happen, so there is a wide range of control and possible improvements.

By the way, I'd want to remind about very-very useful option, located in **Settings,** called **Automatically download updates**. What it does is, well, it downloads updates… automatically. **But does not apply them!** Meaning that it won't break anything, the only difference from fully manual update is that you will skip download time.
