# [HotkeyIsActive](/en/triggers/hotkey-is-active) Trigger Improvements

Added a new option that resets the trigger state (deactivates the trigger) whenever linked auras are deactivated. 

The most practical application of this feature is for a linked aura that includes a WindowIsActive trigger. By default, the behavior is as follows:

- If the selected window is active, the trigger behaves normally and can be activated by a simple key press.
- If the selected window is not active, the trigger won't capture key presses. To deactivate the trigger, you must first bring the selected window to the foreground.

With the new option ("Reset trigger state when linked auras are not active") enabled, the behavior changes to:

- If the selected window is active, the trigger behaves normally and can be activated by a simple key press.
- If the selected window is not active, the trigger will automatically deactivate as soon as it detects this state.

This makes it extremely easy to set up a key that activates certain functionality only when a game is active and automatically deactivates it when you alt-tab or minimize the game.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements
- **[Overlays]** Fixed a longstanding issue where overlays were sometimes sent to the background. This fix affects all overlays in the program, including OSD.
- **[Crash]** Fixed a crash that occurred when the configuration was copy-pasted to another computer. Additional steps will be taken towards improving program portability in the near future.
- **[Scripting]** Exposed properties that control OnScreenDisplay in Search Triggers, allowing you to toggle them via code.
