# [HotkeyIsActive](/en/triggers/hotkey-is-active) trigger improvements
Added new option, which resets trigger state (deactivates the trigger) whenever linked auras are deactivated. 
The most obvious practical application of this is having linked aura, which has WindowIsActive trigger in it. 
By default, having linked aura(in this case, with WindowIsActive trigger) does the following:
- If selected window is active, Trigger behaves normally - it can be activated by a simple key press 
- If selected window is NOT active, Trigger won't capture key presses at all, i.e. to deactive the trigger, you have to bring selected window to foreground first

Setting new option ("Reset trigger state when linked aura are not active") will change the behavior:
- If selected window is active, Trigger behaves normally - it can be activated by a simple key press 
- If selected window is NOT active, Trigger will automatically deactivate itself as soon as it will detect it

This make it extremely easy to setup a key which will be activating some functionality only when game is active and automatically deactivate it as soon as you've alt-tabbed or minimized the game.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Overlays] Hopefully, fixed a long-living problem with Overlays sometimes being sent to background - this should affect ALL overlays in the program, including OSD
- [Crash] Fixed crash which occurred when configuration was copy-pasted to another computer. I will do additional steps towards program portability in the nearest future
- [Scripting] Exposed properties which control OnScreenDisplay in Search Triggers - you can now toggle them via code
