Last patch of 2023 addresses some issues with network messages and advanced input methods(low-level NT*).  At this point, I will start focusing on the next big feature of 2024 - behaviour trees, which will basically rethink the way you work with the program making it much-much easier to do automations.

## Happy new year everyone!
