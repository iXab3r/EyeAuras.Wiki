# Behavior Trees - added **Invert** option to some of the nodes
The new option is available only in those nodes which work with image capture right now - pixel color checks, ML, image search, etc. 
It is very simple and semantically equivalent to [Inverter node](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/behavior-trees/nodes/inverter), but built in.
The reason is BTs tend to grow very-very quickly and reducing overall amount of nodes should help keeping them structured.

p.s. I know these have been quiet few weeks, internally I am working on a new large feature, which will be available to public later this year. I'll keep you posted.


## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [BT] Fixed a bug which lead to showing a bunch of errors whenever you've removed multiple nodes in a bulk
