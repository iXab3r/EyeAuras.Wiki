### **Auto-Update Enhancements**

A new option in **Settings** has been introduced: "**Automatically Download Updates**". This ensures that a new version is downloaded in the background as soon as it's available and you'll be able to install the update much quicker than before.Â 

- You retain the choice to postpone an update if you're not ready for an installation right now. The system will wait for your command!
- Curious about the update? Simply click on the cloud icon to access the popup with detailed information.
- I've refined the popup's behaviour to make it less intrusive. Rather than being alerted with pop-ups for every minor update or information, you'll now see a discreet notification adjacent to a tiny cloud icon in the window title.
- Error notifications have also been streamlined. Short error messages will appear beside the cloud icon, while comprehensive error details will be reserved for the popup.
- Changelog has also been rewritten from the ground up. Feel free to comment on new UX, your opinion does matter!

#### **BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS**

- **[SendInput] [Usb2Kbd]** I've introduced a new "**CharSet**" option, enabling you to choose between **ANSI** and **Unicode**. This enhancement is geared towards ensuring compatibility across various OS versions. The default setting is **ANSI**, which should suffice for the majority of users.
