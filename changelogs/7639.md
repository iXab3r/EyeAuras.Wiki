# C# Scripting Engine V3 - added Blazor/Razor support
Major upgrade in the scripting engine - it can now compile [Razor components](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/?view=aspnetcore-8.0). [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) ([Razor components](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/?view=aspnetcore-8.0) are part of [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) infrastructure) is one of the best (my opinion - for desktop apps just **the best**) UI technology which allows to have full power of C# and at the same time great performance/convenience of Web (HTML/CSS/JS) world. 

*EyeAuras is also using it under the hood since 2023 and is gradually being rewritten from WPF to Blazor. At some point in the future is expected to become full Blazor-driven app. Parts which are using it - BT editor, Macro editor, EventLog, Bindings, AuraTree. If some part of the program feels **snappy** you can bet it is using Blazor.*

Previously, if you wanted to develop your own user interface for your bot, the only viable option
was to use [WebUI Overlay](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/custom-ui) which at this point is using very dated text editor and, more importantly, uses older version of the scripting engine back from April 2023(!). Of course, you could load up the project in your IDE of choice (like Visual Studio or Rider), but that was definitely not very convenient. 

BTs, Macros and C# Action/Trigger have been using the newer iteration of scripting engine since Jan 2024, but there was a problem - V3 did not have Blazor support. At all. That was technically challenging and required to line up quite a lot of other systems to do it properly. 

And, finally, we're getting the first prototype. 

### What it already can do:
- you can create custom UI components right there in that same text editor
- full auto-completion for C# part of Razor component and partial - for Razor part
- API which allows to create windows and manage with your components right from your code
- **thread-safety** - in contrast with WPF/WinForms and even official MS Blazor integration, EA API is thread-safe, meaning you can update properties of the window from any thread and it is expected to be able to properly process those. No longer you have to worry about deadlocks and UI marshalling using Invoke/BeginInvoke. 

### What it cannot do (yet):
- No integration with IDE like in V2 - will be added later
- no hot-reload like in WebUI - there will be a next iteration of WebUI which will be using this new script engine somewhere in Dec/Jan or maybe even earlier
