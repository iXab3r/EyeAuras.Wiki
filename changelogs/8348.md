## Performance - Macros UI optimizations
Done some major changes in how Macros are rendered, the overall UX should be better. Please, report any inconsistentices you may notice. There will be more changes in the following weeks, trying to address initial (first) rendering performance. 

## C# Scripting - Razor namespaces declaration
Probably it will be easier to show, lets take, for example a very basic Razor component created via :
![New Component](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/05/NVIDIA_Overlay_ME5Vh0s9oD.png)

That is what we get as a result
### UserComponent.razor
```html
@namespace GameGrind
@inherits BlazorReactiveComponent
<!-- your Razor/HTML markup here -->
```

### UserComponent.cs
```csharp 
namespace GameGrind;

public partial class UserComponent : BlazorReactiveComponent {
    //some code here
}
```
Note that random namespace (`GameGrind`, in this case) which previously was automatically inserted whenever you added a new Razor Component.
This is minor, but very inconvenient technical requirement that the scripting system had. 
One of such inconveniences would be the fact that such code could not be easily copy-pasted to another EyeAuras script - you either had to change the namespace **OR** had to deal with the fact that you have multiple different non-related namespaces in your code. None of those are good thing to have. 
From now on, namespace declaration is **not a requirement anymore** - you can omit namespace declaration in **BOTH** `.razor` and `.cs` files and EyeAuras will automatically insert them during compilation. Less code = less headache = better life. 
 
## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Overlays] Changed how overlay is rendered on the screen (Hide/Show order during startup) - should make things appear on the screen a bit faster
- [UI] Improved responsiveness of drag'n'drop in Macros/BTs
- [Macros] Fixed a problem with Repeat/IfThenElse - drag'n'drop was not working properly
- [Macros] Fixed a problem with Cloning - from now, the entire hierarchy will be preserved and not only the selected node
