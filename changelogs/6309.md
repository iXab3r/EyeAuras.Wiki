## Rework of Preview window in Image/Color/ML/Text Search triggers
Major rework of region selection and capture image preview.  

- **Gradual Zoom** - now you can use mouse wheel to zoom in/out. Hold **left** mouse button to pan the image
- **Selection rework** - now you can select region on a preview and use **Ctrl+C** or button from toolbar to copy part of the image to clipboard or use it as search template
- **Save screenshot / video** - this was available for quite some time in Effects window, UI has changed and now it is available in the preview pane for easier access
- **Video playback** - you can now **load any video** in Preview pane and use it for extracting template image out of it or picking a correct capture region.
  - Note: ability to fully replace captured stream with a video footage will be released a bit later. This will allow to tweak your auras without running actual game!

Aside from that, by default, UI for these types of triggers is a bit simplified (with ability to enable advanced mode) to make it less scary for newcomers.

## Replay functionality in Image/Color/ML/Text Search triggers (alpha)
There was always a problem with capturing images that are animated - blinking icons, short buffs/debuffs, etc. This is not solved now - new **Replay** button allows you to record a video and playback it right after in built-in video player. Zoom, region selection, copying to clipboard - everything is available with more things to come (like applying effects to video footage).

## Network messages broadcasting functionality (early-early alpha)
[Send Message](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/send-network-message) / [Network Message](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/triggers/network-message) action/trigger pair is a powerful tool that can help you to build your own controllable network of inter-connected EyeAuras. This has been available for a few years at that point and is used mostly for multi-boxing (on multiple PCs) purposes.

What was always a problem is latency - all messages had to come through one of EyeAuras servers, which introduced latency. New broadcasting mode allows you to use your **local network** to exchange messages between PCs. This basically eliminates any latency.

The feature is still in early alpha and very rough on configuration side of things - you have to specify IP range manually. In final version this will probably be done automatically by software.

To use this new feature, set **ChannelId** to:

- On **Server** EyeAuras (one that listens for messages) - set **broadcast://255.255.255.255/anychannelname**
- On **Client** EyeAuras (one which sends messages) - set **broadcast://192.168.1.255/anychannelname**

**Important! 192.168.1.255 is an example, replace 192.168.1 with your actual subnet. You can leave the final “255” intact as this instructs the program to broadcast the message to whole subnet rather than to a specific IP**

p.s. by default, the program uses port **53082** for communications, you can pick any other port if you want right after **IP** in **ChannelId** (e.g. **broadcast://172.16.15.255:55055/mychannel**)

## **BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS**
- Added **Getting Started** pane which is displayed in empty Auras. It has **Import**/**Subscribe** buttons which should make life easier for guys who just want to use someone else's aura pack
- [**Search Triggers**] Fixed bug with some capture sources(e.g. **Shared Surface**) that happened when **Capture Borderless** is selected
- [**Bugfix**] Fixed a bug which in some cases led to program deadlocking at startup (very long-living and nasty bug, hopefully it is finally dead)
- [**WindowSelector**] WindowSelector now captures process name as a final argument. Previously, when you picked a window, the program captured “**Window handle OR Window Title**”. Now it is “**Window Handle OR Window Title OR Process Name**”
- [**Bugfix**] Fixed rare crash in LegacyScriptReferencesResolver
- [**Bugfix**] Fixed bug in aura selection window - in some cases auras were hidden and not available for selection
- A LOT of work on Behavior Trees. First version is planned to be released at the end of Feb.
