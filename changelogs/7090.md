# Scripting improvements
## Added cross-aura references
Long-awaited change that allows you to link mutiple auras, that contain some C# code together and re-use methods, classes and everything else as if it would be a single script.
This allows you to write some utility functions once and then use them whenever you need. From now on, amount of copy-paste required for large programs hopefully will be close to 0.
The change affects both Auras and Behavior Trees - by referencing Aura from Behavior Tree you will make shared code available across all nodes of that tree.

To link auras together just add Reference like on the picture below

## How is it useful to me ?
For example, in your "library" Aura you can store a bunch of classes which will be used for storing user configuration 
or will simulate user input in some specific way. Or maybe you want to draw something on the screen using OnScreenDisplay.



## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Crash] Fixed crash which rarely occurred in TimerTrigger during startup
- [Crash] Muted crash which happened if overlay is already disposed #EA-441 v7008 by n1katio
- [BehaviorTrees] UI refactoring - more space, moved blackboard to separate tab
- [BehaviorTrees] Made it possible to zoom in/zoom out the whole control - that way you can make side panels occupy less space if needed
- [BehaviorTrees] Improved Copy/Paste experience - the program will now try to position pasted nodes right where your mouse is
- [BehaviorTrees] [Wait](/en/behavior-trees/nodes/wait) and [Cooldown](/en/behavior-trees/nodes/cooldown) nodes now allow to configure randomized time spans
- [UI] Enabled config Version Control System by default for new users
- [Scripting] IBehaviorTreeAccessor now offers Tick method which allows to manually control ticks of the tree
- [Scripting] IBehaviorTreeAccessor now allows to remotely access Blackboard
- [Scripting] Improved user-level exceptions visualization
- [Scripting] ScriptVariable now does not erase previously stored values in case of type mismatch
