# Performance optimizations - ALPHA
Major changes in how EyeAuras manages memory for the images. 
May make things better, may break everything - we'll see. 

# ML Search Trigger - Added default models download
For a demonstration purposes and for some quick testing, added selector which allows you to 
download one of well-known Yolo models, including those which feature Segmentation and Classification. 
Selector is available only when model is NOT loaded.

E.g. here are results of `Yolo 8 Small - Segmentation`

and here are results of the latest `Yolo 12 Turbo - Small` - notice that even Turbo version nowadays not only yields more reliable results, but it also is able to detect more objects(person in the car) on the scene. Thank you, progress :)

# ML Search Trigger - Changed Resize Method - Breaking change
When you're using ML model, it usually has hard-coded resolution, e.g. `640x640`.
When ML model gets fed with an Image, that image must be resized to accomodate model's resolution - there is no other way around it.
Depending on how the training process is done, usually it is either Letterboxing (adding black bars without changing aspect ration) or Stretching.

Previously, EyeAuras was trying to "guess" the best method depending on model type and version, but this introduced more confusion than helped. 

That is why, from now on, default resize method is Stretching and if you want to change that - just throw in Resize effect and pick whichever method fits your model best.

1) Open Effects window

2) Added Resize Effect and setup it accordingly to your model resolution/type

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Capture] Fixed a problem with region-selection in Preview window when Resize/Rescale effects were applied
