# Server-side improvements
Worked on stability - should solve those problems which crashed server under peak load. Now it should just slow down :D
Thanks everyone who became part of that pleasant problem, welcome aboard :)


# Portable version
Added new button to main web page which allow to download archive with the most recent version. It will be fully portable with a config that is separate from the main app. This mechanism has already been tested for a few months in Packs, so should work without major issues.

p.s. Please not that portable version is not available for Stable **yet**, it will be available right after I will push alpha to stable in the next few days.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Scripting] Added TargetWindow to ISendInputUnstableScriptingApi - this allows to use Windows Message API and send inputs to background windows.
- [UI] Improved Import/Export dialogs error handling - errors should be more meaningful now and shown in a more presentable way
- [UI] Added badge which shows how many auras are there in Archived state. This is god-forbidden functionality which allows to Archive(aka unload and hide) auras which you currently do not use - this speeds up app load process quite a lot.
