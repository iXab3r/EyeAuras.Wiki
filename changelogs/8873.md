# ALPHA! Performance improvements 
This version contains more than a dozen different improvements and performance optimizations which I have preparing for quite some time at this point. 
For the next couple of weeks there may be instabilities, but for most use cases, especially for scripting in EyePad, this should be night and day difference.

Tested improvements on [ImGui-based](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/imgui/getting-started) bot - it is now possible to push 2k fps range. That is **WITH** memory reading and parsing all needed game structures! So, basically, that is bot-loop running at ~2k ticks per second - before today's fixes FPS was around 400-500.

Next goal will be working on stabilizing the FPS and making it smoother, right now it is quite "spiky" - I already wrote about adapting [new prototype-GC](https://blog.applied-algorithms.tech/a-sub-millisecond-gc-for-net) in changelog for [1.7.8559](/en/changelogs/8559) a couple of months ago, this should help exactly with that goal. 

**Please report anything you'll notice!**

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [Scripting] Improved Scripts deallocation - even if user script contains some dangling references, EyeAuras will try to clean them up if the script is no longer running
- [BehaviorTree] Improved performance in BTs
