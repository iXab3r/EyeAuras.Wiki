# New Node - Pixel Search - Early prototype
Let's welcome a new node which is accessible in Macros and BTs.
It is the first one in the batch of nodes coming soon, nodes, focusing on computer-vision.
Those nodes will be a direct replacement of triggers, which you're currently using in Auras.
Migration process will take a lot of time and probably new Nodes will reach feature parity with corresponding Triggers only months from now,
but eventually we'll get there.

Note, that Nodes DO NOT tick on their own. Image capture and analysis happens exactly at the same moment when the node gets executed.

## Performance
Initially, performance of nodes could be worse than those that we had in Triggers - this is due to new mechanisms which were implemented for [Computer Vision API](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/api/IComputerVisionExperimentalScriptingApi) which powers those new nodes.

# Clicking on found Images/Pixels in Macros and Behavior Trees
New Nodes will be writing their results to [Variables](/scripting/examples/basic/variables) which are available via [Bindings](/features/bindings).
For now, there is a single variable `CvLastFoundRegion` which will contain **the last** found region. This could be coordinates of a found pixel. Or coordinates of found image. Or ML class.

## MouseMove Node
In MouseMove, there is now a new button, which allows to very quickly and easily use that variable as a source of coordinates.

Just click on the button, and, when executed, MouseMove will try to read coordinates from that variable.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
- [BT] Added new button which allows to run BT/node until stopped 
- [TextSearch] Fixed a problem in TextSearch - IncludeTextSegments was not saved into config
