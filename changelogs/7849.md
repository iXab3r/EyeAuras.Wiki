# Color Search - added Similarity Range selection
Added new feature - now you can specify **Similarity** range which is required for trigger to be **Active**.
By default, trigger is active only if Similarity is above given threshold, e.g.
![MinSimilarity](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2024/12/NVIDIA_Overlay_C1in52sM4hVMAddL.png)

Now you can specify range of Min/Max values for similarity, e.g.
![MinMaxSimilarity](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2024/12/f6CzBzJHsOCcBxRr.png)

In this case, even if Similarity would reach **100%**, trigger still will be **Inactive**, because expected value must be in range `55.95` to `62.94` (inclusively)

# Reminder - Replay in Capture triggers
Just want to highlight a feature that was added long time ago and is extremely useful in some niche situations, e.g. when you need to capture the color or image of some short-living buff or debuff.

You just press Replay, the program starts saving the footage into temporary video file. 
![Replay](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2024/12/hmkD46KZe6xmHpya.png)

When done, just press Stop

Preview window will now switch to mode which loads image data from the video file. You can now work with that footage just like if that would be the real captured image - pick pixels, copy regions to clipboard, etc. When no longer needed, just switch to default `Image as is` option in bottom right corner.
