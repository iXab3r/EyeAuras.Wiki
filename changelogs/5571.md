## Added new text recognition technique via Windows OCR
### What does that mean? 

In [TextSearch](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/e/en/triggers/images/text-search) trigger there will be new options in “Symbols” dropdown, which will allow you to use Windows-based Optical Character Recognition (converting image to text), which proved to be more reliable and performance than the previous **Tesseract**-based version used in **EyeAuras**

Note, that to use Windows OCR you have to have specific language pack installed in the system, i.e. if you want to recognize spanish characters - you have to have Spanish locale installed. 

Also, there is one limitation, which I still have to address - Windows OCR does not support multi-language OCR, i.e. it is not possible to recognize russian and english characters in the same sentence, for example.  There are some industry-proven techniques which allow to override this, but I want this method to be tested first without additional code on top of it.

Few tips:

- **Binary thresholding** which was widely used for Tesseract OCR, is **much less effective** for Windows OCR, which improves performance and reliability at the same time
- **Size matters**. If OCR returns an empty text - just add scaling via UI settings, in many cases doing minor adjustments to size of an image may drastically improve the results
- If you have installed new language and it does not appear in the dropdown - just restart the app
- more details could be found in [wiki](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/e/en/triggers/images/text-search)

#### BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS
- **[Image Effects]** Improved Eyedropper functionality - now you can specify range, which will be applied to picked color. Precise will make it pick an exact match, narrow/wide will apply scaling to create a region.
