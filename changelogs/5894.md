### **New C# scripting engine is available in Triggers/Actions - alpha**

I will post more info in the coming days, but, all-in-all, the **C# engine** which was already used in [WebUI](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/overlays/custom-ui) to leverage awesomeness of Blazor has been ported and now it also available in C# action and trigger. That means that EVERY feature that you could use in WebUI is now available in triggers/actions as well, such as:

- using new and improved APIs, such as [Interface IAuraTreeScriptingApi | EyeAuras Docs](https://docs.eyeauras.net/api/EyeAuras.Scripting.Api.IAuraTreeScriptingApi.html), [Interface IVariablesScriptingApi | EyeAuras Docs](https://docs.eyeauras.net/api/EyeAuras.Scripting.Api.IVariablesScriptingApi.html), [Interface IAuraAccessor | EyeAuras Docs](https://docs.eyeauras.net/api/EyeAuras.Scripting.Api.IAuraAccessor.html) etc
  - These APIs are guaranteed to be held compatible in future versions, I will be putting effort in this regard. Whenever I'll need to do a breaking change, there will be a special compatibility layer built on top of older APIs to avoid breaking the code.
  - The plan is to allow scripts to [inject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) a set of APIs (e.g. SendInputScriptingApi), which will provide easy access to Image analysis, Send Input and all the other features that are currently present in EyeAuras
  - APIs of triggers/actions/overlays are still subject to change as I do not have good solution for compatibility layer there yet
- using multiple files to hold all your source code in a structured way
- referencing other C#-based auras to get access to classes/methods implemented there. I.e. you can prepare a single aura with all your utility functions and use it in your projects
- exporting **csproj** and editing code in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) / [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- real-time editing the project via Monitor. This is not as useful as with **WebUI** though.

Auto-completion is disabled for now, I have not decided yet whether to migrate to [Monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) right away or do some improvements on the existing text editor. Will revert with update asap.

One of the best things in this is that now, when the scripting system is homogenous, **any** improvement will be instantly reflected everywhere - **WebUI/C# action/trigger** and **Behaviour Trees.**

**P.S. Behaviour trees,** most probably, will be released in **December** and will rely on the same engine. Stay tuned as it will be very-very cool, I can promise you that :)

### **New API Documentation website**

A new website hosting the API documentation for EyeAuras is now available at [https://docs.eyeauras.net](https://docs.eyeauras.net).

This will be particularly useful for those using EyeAuras as a scripting platform. However, the [Wiki](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/) remains the **primary source for non-developers**.

Currently, the documentation lacks a demos and examples section, which is essential for any documentation. Efforts led by myself and linqse in **December** will focus on enriching this area. Additionally, most public interfaces and classes now include XML comments.

If any crucial information is missing, please bring it to our attention.

### **Enhanced Error Reporting Mechanism**

Understanding the specifics of what went wrong is crucial when issues arise. Our new error reporting mechanism aggregates all errors within the scope of an Action/Trigger or an entire Aura. These errors are hierarchical, meaning Aura errors include all errors from their actions/triggers, similar to folders. Users can mark errors as read at their convenience.

### **Performance Improvement - Properties Caching (Alpha)**

Introducing a new feature aimed at significantly reducing the number of disk reads/writes and slightly decreasing CPU load. This feature is still under testing and can be enabled in the Settings under the Properties Caching option.

### **BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS**

- [Volume Trigger]: Temporarily disabled due to conflicts with a subsystem.
- Safe Mode: Enhanced the mechanism that detects improper application exits.
- [Image Trigger]: Added functionality to copy the template image to the clipboard and paste from it.
- [C# Code Editor]: Performance enhancements make the editor more responsive. We plan to eventually migrate to the Monaco editor.
