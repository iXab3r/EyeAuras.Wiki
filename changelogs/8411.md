# DMA-integration improvements
EyeAuras uses LeechCore, which is a fantastic library developed by [Ulf Frisk](https://github.com/ufrisk), to integrate with DMA-devices out there. De-facto, LeechCore is a standard with which most devices out there are compatible. 

For now, that integration is still in alpha-stage, drop me a message if you want to help with testing and are interested in developing something. 
Realistically, development using FPGA-board does not differ in any way from using ReadProcessMemory - EyeAuras abstracts you from all the complexities of managing LC API, reconnects, error handling, etc. All you have to focus on is writing a code.

## Bugfixes/Improvements
