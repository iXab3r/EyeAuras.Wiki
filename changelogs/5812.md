### CVATAAT  improvements (aka [YoloEase](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/YoloEase))

A bunch of different fixes and improvements. The most noticeable one is that the app now supports working on multiple projects at the same time - you can save/load/share configuration files and train multiple models.

Ah, and I changed the name to be a more reflective on what the tool actually does.

#### **BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS**
- Improved startup time, should be especially noticeable if you're using scripts
- Tweaked logging to minimize performance impact
- Multiple UX/UI changes in Bindings editor
