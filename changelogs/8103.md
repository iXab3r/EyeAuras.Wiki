# Packing - Distribution Policy 
Added new option, which intends to do two things:

**1) Try to lower entry bar for new users**
Practice has shown, that many new users, given link to pack's page, instead of downloading the pack, which would contain compatible version of EyeAuras and scripts, choose to download standalone version and Import pack manually. This could lead to a lot of problems, such as:
- pack could be published using `Alpha` version and user downloaded `Stable` - most of the time Stable is not compatible as it is older and has less functionality
- when importing multiple Packs into the same EA, it is very easy to go over Free tier limit of 10 auras. Packs help to avoid that - you can have as many Free-tier packs as you want running simultaneously. I do not want to force people into buying the subscription that way - it is intended that Pro tier is only for complex packs of auras 
- by importing the pack manually, users usually do not use Subscriptions/Synchronization mechanism which can provide description of the pack/track pack updates and simplify the process of working with the pack in general. Packs solve that by having Synchronization set from the very beginning

**2) Simplify packs support for authors** 
If authors are 100% sure, that users are using a specific portable version of EA, it makes things easier for them to debug and troubleshoot. This should make things more supportable long-term.

## Pack Distribution Policy
- `Any` -> If set, users can either `Import` the script or `Download Pack`
- `Prefer Packed` - If set, users can either `Import` the script or `Download Pack`, but there will be focus on downloading packed version
- `Packed Only` - If set, users can `Download Pack`, but `Import` in any form is not allowed

# Packing - authors-only - editing options on the website is disabled
**There is no loss of functionality, everything is still editable via EyeAuras UI**

Previously, it was possible to edit Packaging option on both EA desktop app and on the website as well (application name, config options, etc). 
I am changing how the packaging works in general and to make things more stable, I've disabled editing pack options on the website. 

This may come back in the future, but for now, the primary way of editing `Packaging Options` is via EyeAuras UI
