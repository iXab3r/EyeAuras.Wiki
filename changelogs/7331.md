# Real alpha-version, only for those who are ready :)
This version contains a bunch of updates of critical libraries which may bring the whole program to its knees in a whole bunch of different forms.

The goal is to get a good stable-enough version which could live for the next 2-3 months till NY.
I may be able to fit 1 functional improvement which is enhancment in sub-trees, but no guarantees
