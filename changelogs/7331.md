# Real alpha, for those who are strong :)
This version contains a bunch of updates of critical libraries which may bring the whole program to its knees in a whole bunch of different forms.

There will be only 1 functional change (enhanced sub-trees) and bugfixes in the next two weeks. The goal is to get a good stable-enough version which could live for the next 2-3 months till NY
