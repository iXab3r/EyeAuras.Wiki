# New Release ‚Äì 1.8 ([RU](/ru/changelogs/8552)/[EN](/en/changelogs/8552))
What's New?

## Mini-apps ‚Äì EyeAuras-based Standalone Applications
Over the past few months, most of the development has been focused on C# scripting. Many changes were introduced, primarily aimed at simplifying development and improving compatibility with various NuGet packages. The focus shifted from visual programming towards improving the user experience when working with scripts. The goal is to make it as easy and intuitive as possible to create mini-apps that do something useful ‚Äî whether it be a small automation tool or a full-fledged bot. Under the hood, they will leverage the full power of EyeAuras, but on the surface ‚Äî it's entirely up to you.

To support this, there's already a powerful feature set:

- [Packs](/features/packs) ‚Äì the ability to bundle your application into a portable ZIP archive
-- Includes built-in support for updates, rollbacks, settings persistence, etc. Everything EyeAuras has gained over the years is now available to your apps.
- [Script Protection](/features/script-protection) ‚Äì the code you write will be protected from prying eyes
-- Essential for most paid applications. You don't even have to worry about how it works internally.
- [Sublicenses](/features/sublicenses) ‚Äì if your mini-app is not free, you can easily integrate a sublicensing system based on EyeAuras infrastructure for license payments and tracking, while you receive the revenue.

And that‚Äôs not all ‚Äî crypto payment support and full UI hiding will be added soon, along with many other improvements. The mission is to **drastically** reduce the time between having an idea and getting your app running on a happy user's machine.

I believe mini-apps may become the primary way to fund the rest of EyeAuras development (discussed below). Time will tell how accurate that assumption is.

## What About Behavior Trees, Macros, Auras?

Nothing bad! Yes, upcoming months will likely be script-focused, but the roadmap includes:

### Full Migration of EyeAuras to a New UI Framework

This includes auras, triggers, and actions. The annoying lags when switching auras will finally be gone. Load times will improve by \~3‚Äì5 seconds. This migration will take about **one year**.

### Introduction of a New Automation System ‚Äì Blueprints

We already have Auras, Macros, Behavior Trees, and Scripts. Each has its strengths: Trees for bots, Auras for small automations (e.g., auto-pots), Macros for predefined action sequences, and Scripts as a universal hammer.

But there‚Äôs always room to grow. Inspired by [Unreal Engine Blueprints](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine), we aim to create a new visual programming tool: Blueprints. The idea is to place Auras and logic blocks on the same canvas (similar to BT editor) and define interactions between them ‚Äî reactions to aura triggers, execution sequences, event logic, loops, etc. You can also call BTs and Macros from within.

This will take months, but initial prototypes may appear later this year.

## EyeAuras SDK (NuGet Package)

This is the logical evolution of mini-apps ‚Äî but with **your** app as the primary product, and EyeAuras becomes a toolkit.

Want to capture the screen? Done. Simulate input using 10+ methods? No problem. Embed C# scripting so users can write their own automation logic? Yes ‚Äî EyeAuras scripting is now a standalone, mature engine.

Every capability in EyeAuras is available as a plug-in module.

The technical challenges have been solved. Early SDK versions can already be used in C# projects via NuGet. Licensing/distribution details are being finalized. The SDK will be **commercial** ‚Äî one-time purchase, use it however and as much as you like. It will be a fully autonomous product, not tied to EyeAuras infrastructure.

Expect more info in the second half of the year.

# DMA / FPGA Integration [EN](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/features/dma) / [RU](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/ru/features/dma)

üìé More info, examples, and scripts ‚Äî [here](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/advanced/memory/rpm-read)

**DMA (Direct Memory Access)** is a technology that allows reading or writing data directly to computer RAM **without involving the CPU or OS**. This makes it possible to access any process‚Äôs memory, even those protected by anti-cheat systems or technologies like Kernel Patch Protection (KPP), HVCI, and user-mode hooks.

## What does it offer?

- **Full access to all memory** ‚Äî including the kernel and protected processes. Both read and write are supported.
- Analyze anti-cheat-protected games without risk of detection.
- Use EyeAuras C# scripting on top of raw hardware. You work with memory as if it‚Äôs `ReadProcessMemory`, but behind the scenes, you‚Äôre talking directly to the PCIe bus.

All of this is now available in the familiar EyeAuras scripting model ‚Äî no need for HDL, PCIe knowledge, virtualization, or drivers.

## Status & Roadmap

- ‚úÖ Basic DMA read/write
- ‚úÖ EXE/DLL module resolution via virtual addresses
- ‚úÖ Integrated with `IMemory` and `IProcess` APIs
- ‚è≥ Advanced diagnostics/debugging tools (for cases of firmware instability or failures)
- ‚è≥ Read/write performance improvements
- ‚è≥ DMA-based DLL injection into a target process

# ImGui Integration [EN](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/imgui/getting-started) / [RU](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/ru/scripting/imgui/getting-started)

Native ImGui integration is in progress ‚Äî a modern, imperative-style UI option to complement the existing Blazor model.

[ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) ("Immediate Mode GUI") is a fast, lightweight UI library designed for tools in game engines. Used in many AAA editors, it‚Äôs known for its speed, ease of use, and live updates every frame.

In EyeAuras this means:

- Lightning-fast UI rendering without HTML/DOM/JS overhead
- Easy for beginners ‚Äî simple UIs in 10 lines of code
- Quickly visualize bot state: checkboxes, logs, counters, overlays
- Suitable for one-file mini-apps with UI + logic in a single `.csx`

Here's an example (also covered in the [guide](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/imgui/getting-started)):

```csharp
AddNewExtension<ImGuiContainerExtensions>();

var osd = GetService<IImGuiExperimentalApi>()
    .AddTo(ExecutionAnchors);

osd.AddRenderer(() =>
{
    ImGui.Begin("My UI");
    ImGui.Text("Control window flags and interaction behavior.");

    var isActive = Trigger.TriggerValue ?? false;
    if (ImGui.Checkbox("Is Active", ref isActive))
    {
        Trigger.TriggerValue = isActive;
    }
    ImGui.SameLine();
    ImGui.TextDisabled("(Gets/Sets whether Trigger is active or not)");

    ImGui.Separator();

    if (Trigger.IsActive == true)
    {
        ImGui.TextColored(new Vector4(0f, 1f, 0f, 1f), "Trigger is currently ACTIVE");
    }
    else
    {
        ImGui.TextColored(new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, 1f), "Trigger is currently INACTIVE");
    }

    ImGui.End();
});
```

Now you can build truly standalone mini-apps inside a single `.csx` file.

# Usb2Kbd ‚Äì Hardware Input Emulator [EN](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/usb2kbd) / [RU](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/ru/actions/sendinput/usb2kbd)

`Usb2Kbd` is a hardware input emulator supported in EyeAuras since \~2021.

Now you can build your own for about **\$10** using an inexpensive board from AliExpress or Amazon.

Here‚Äôs a detailed step-by-step guide: [Russian](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/ru/actions/sendinput/usb2kbd) / [English](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/actions/sendinput/usb2kbd)

The backend has also been improved and the settings window redesigned for a better user experience.

![Usb2Kbd](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/06/msedge_P2Eq9jsv2R9Kquro.png)

# Behavior Trees / Macros
## Action Nodes Now Have Outputs

All action nodes (e.g., Wait, MouseMove, KeyPress, etc.) now support outputs. The linked node is executed only if the current one succeeds.

![Output](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/05/NVIDIA_Overlay_jFlQ5lvwcE.png)

## Default Properties Support

You can now set `Target Window` and `Input Simulator` for each tree or macro individually. As before, properties can still be set at the folder level ‚Äî this adds flexibility, not a replacement.

![Settings](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/05/NVIDIA_Overlay_fzMMGUhGglAudwms.png)

# C# Scripting Improvements

## Referencing Other Scripts from BTs / Macros

You can now reference another Aura containing a `C# Script` action ‚Äî similar to referencing a different project in software development.

All types and classes defined in that script become available for use in your BTs or Macros.

This feature has been around for a while but was previously hidden from public view as it wasn‚Äôt stable enough.

![References](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/05/NVIDIA_Overlay_i7vzCPLHmT.png =x300)

## How is this useful?

Now you can define a C# class that analyzes the game ‚Äî via memory or CV ‚Äî and feeds data into your Behavior Tree. Instead of cluttering the BT with dozens of variables and conditions, you can encapsulate all logic in a single class (e.g., `TheGame`).

[Example bot that uses this model](https://onelineplayer.com/player?autoplay=true&autopause=false&muted=true&loop=true&url=https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/04/2025-04-19%2017-19-38-00.58.28.050-01.01.51.733.mkv)

More info [here](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/changelogs/8378)

## Razor Namespace Declaration No Longer Required

Here‚Äôs a typical Razor component from before:

`UserComponent.razor`

```html
@namespace GameGrind
@inherits BlazorReactiveComponent
<!-- your Razor/HTML code -->
```

`UserComponent.cs`

```csharp
namespace GameGrind;

public partial class UserComponent : BlazorReactiveComponent {
    // some code
}
```

That namespace (`GameGrind`) used to be autogenerated, making it hard to copy/paste between scripts without conflicts.

Now, **namespace declarations are optional** ‚Äî EyeAuras injects them at compile time. Less code = fewer headaches.

## Two New ML + OSD Examples

Fixed an issue with `ComputerVision API` not loading models/images via HTTP. Two example bots were added:

### [Aim Trainer 2D ML Aimbot+ESP](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/advanced/aimtracker-ml-ea)

This example shows how to:

- Find a window by title
- Use `ComputerVision` to find images, run ML, OCR, etc.
- Use `SendInput` to simulate user input
- Use `OnScreenCanvas` to draw overlays
- Detect objects with a pretrained ML model
- Aim the mouse and click center
- Draw object/window position on-screen via OSD

![Aim Trainer](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/06/CFOcCLFzsgx9ODKT.gif =x200)

### [Aim Trainer 2D ML Aimbot+ESP (ImGui)](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/examples/advanced/aimtrainer-ml)

Same as above, but uses [ImGui](https://wiki.eyeauras.net/en/scripting/imgui/getting-started) for UI and overlays.

# Performance Improvements
## Upgrade to .NET 8

.NET is the platform that powers EyeAuras. .NET 8 was chosen due to [a new memory manager prototype](https://blog.applied-algorithms.tech/a-sub-millisecond-gc-for-net) that outperforms all previous versions.

EyeAuras traditionally prefers increased memory usage for higher performance, so a fast memory collector isn‚Äôt a luxury ‚Äî it‚Äôs a necessity. This version still uses the older GC, but once the new GC is stable, it will be enabled.

![GC time]([https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/05/SkR6d2PSx0.png](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/05/SkR6d2PSx0.png) =x500)

## Folder Property Editor Rewrite

The editor now uses the new UI framework ‚Äî faster and more responsive.

**Old Version:**

**New Version:**
![Modern editor](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/05/NVIDIA_Overlay_hTppLb5Pft7hqfO9.png)

## Macro UI Optimization

Macro rendering has been significantly reworked. You‚Äôll notice the difference especially in large macros (50+ nodes). More updates are coming.

## Overlapping Panels ‚Äì Fixed!

This long-standing bug caused panels to overlap ‚Äî most notably C# Action overlapping Event Log. It‚Äôs known as the [WPF Airspace issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/dwayneneed/mitigating-airspace-issues-in-wpf-applications) and has existed for over **12 years**. In Microsoft‚Äôs UI stack used by EyeAuras, it‚Äôs been around since **July 2020**.

![Before]([https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/07/Discord\_DNgXTIAXKhkV2Fua.png](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/07/Discord_DNgXTIAXKhkV2Fua.png) =x400)

After **years** of waiting, Microsoft finally fixed it. There was no real workaround, so we had to wait.

![Working resize](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/07/EyeAuras_8iHLLblavrONIhfW.gif)

This fix is not just about better UI on small screens ‚Äî it unblocks the long-awaited migration of triggers/actions to the new UI. Previously, everything had to be rewritten at once. Now, it can be done gradually ‚Äî much more manageable.
