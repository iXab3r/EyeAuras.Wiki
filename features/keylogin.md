# 🚪 What is KeyLogin?

**KeyLogin** is a way to sign in using a one-time license key — no account creation required.  
Just enter your key, and the program will automatically create a temporary account for you.  
You can immediately start using all the features that the key unlocks.

> 💡 Your key becomes both the **username and password** for this new account.

### 🆓 Free mode — no limitations

First of all, let’s clarify: you can use EyeAuras **completely free**, with no time limits — the app follows a Freemium model.  
That means the core functionality and most features are available right away.

**However**, some advanced features require activation via a key.  
There’s also a [sublicensing system](/en/features/sublicenses) available to **all users**, which lets you control access to your content packs using keys.  
KeyLogin was designed to make that login flow as simple and fast as possible. Now — let’s dive into how it works.

### 🔐 How can you sign in?

You now have **two** options:

1. **Register an account** and get a username and password — [Create account](https://eyeauras.net/register).  
   You can later attach as many keys to your account as needed.

2. **Log in using just a key**, without registration, via the `I have a key` button:

### ✅ KeyLogin Benefits

- ⚡ **Instant access** — no email, no passwords, no confirmations
- 🔐 **Secure** — the key acts as your password until you choose to change it via [My Account](https://eyeauras.net/my)
- 🔁 **Reusable login** — as long as the password hasn’t changed, you can sign in again
- 🧩 **You can attach more keys later** — even to a \"temporary\" account
- 📜 **View your active keys** — in your [My Account](https://eyeauras.net/my) page
- 🔄 **Switch to a full account later** — by setting your username and password

---

### ⚠️ Limitations and caveats

- 🧾 Your account name will be auto-generated (e.g., `User-9F34`)
- ✍️ Renaming accounts will be available in a **future update**
- 🔑 Keys are **permanently bound** to your account — once activated, they stay linked
- 🔐 After changing your password, login via key will no longer work — use your username/password instead

### ✨ Conclusion

KeyLogin is the fastest way to start using EyeAuras — with no signup, no friction.  
It’s perfect if you just want to enter a key and start working right away.  
Later on, you can always personalize your account and keep using it normally.

> Just click **I have a key**, enter your key — and you’re in. ✅
