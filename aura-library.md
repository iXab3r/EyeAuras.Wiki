[Aura Library](https://eyeauras.net/library) is a feature on the [EyeAuras website](https://eyeauras.net/) that allows users to share and discover auras created by others. By default, all exported or shared auras are **Unlisted**, meaning they can only be accessed through a direct link. However, the author of an aura pack has the ability to change its visibility to Public, thereby allowing it to appear in the Aura Library.

This feature enables users to find, import, and use the auras created by others, or to build upon existing ones.

### **How to Make an Aura Public**

Before making your aura pack public, it's crucial to provide a detailed description of what the pack does. Tagging your pack accurately and giving it a fitting title will make it easier for others to discover. Include any game settings and resolution requirements that might affect the performance of the pack.

After you've provided all the necessary information, you can set your aura pack to Public visibility. Remember, once set to Public, your pack will be visible to all users in the Aura Library.

### **Searching the Aura Library**

The Aura Library supports filters by name, tags, author, visibility, and other features of the pack. This makes it easy for users to find the type of auras they're interested in.

### **Updates and Changes**

When you update an aura pack that you've shared, the changes are automatically picked up by the Aura Library. This ensures that users always have access to the latest versions of your auras.

### **Synchronization**

EyeAuras also provides a synchronization feature. This allows users to monitor a particular Share and receive notifications whenever changes are made. It's similar to subscribing or following a specific author in the Aura Library.

### **Guidelines for Sharing Auras**

1.  Ensure that your aura does not contain any private information such as passwords before sharing it. EyeAuras is currently developing a mechanism for sharing private auras securely, but this feature is not yet available.
2.  Be as detailed as possible in your descriptions and tags. This will help other users understand the purpose of your aura and how to use it.
3.  Try not Â to abuse the system by repeatedly uploading the same or very similar auras. EyeAuras has mechanisms in place to prevent this kind of problem, but it's still in development, so not perfect.
4.  Be aware of the size limits for shared auras: 5MB for non-registered users and 100MB for registered users.
5.  Always respect the rights and work of other users. If you build upon someone else's aura, give them credit for their work.
6.  In the future, EyeAuras plans to introduce features such as user comments and ratings for aura packs, and a moderation process to ensure the content shared in the Aura Library is appropriate and safe.
