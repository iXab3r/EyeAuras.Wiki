# Why?
Many games protected by anti-cheat systems block synthetic (simulated) input. To bypass this, you need to go a level deeper and use either specialized drivers or physical devices (e.g., [Usb2Kbd](/actions/sendinput/usb2kbd)). The TetherScript driver falls into the first category.

![Flow](https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2025/07/ChatGPT%20Image%20Jul%2014%2C%202025%2C%2003_09_58%20PM.png =x200)

# How to Install?

1) Download the driver:
- **(recommended)** EyeAuras mirror – https://s3.eyeauras.net/media/2024/10/HVDK%20Standard%202.1.exe
- or from the official GitHub – https://github.com/tetherscript/hvdk
- or download and install **ControlMyJoystick** from the official website – https://tetherscript.com/controlmyjoystick-home/
IMPORTANT – you **do not** need to purchase **ControlMyJoystick**, we are not planning to use the actual software. We only need the driver that comes with it.

2) Install the driver:
Straightforward – just click Next, Next, Next. In some cases, the installer will ask to reboot your machine.  
That’s it — the driver is now ready to use. Next, we configure **EyeAuras**.

# How to Use?
Set up **EyeAuras** to use the **TetherScript Driver** for simulating input.  
IMPORTANT – do **not mix** different approaches. Choose one method. The most convenient is folder-level configuration.

## Option #1 **(recommended)** Folder Properties
- Select the folder that contains your auras, then go to `Folder Properties`
- Check the `Input Simulator` box and choose **TetherScript Driver** from the dropdown
- All **new** auras and input nodes will now use the driver instead of the default simulator  
p.s. To apply changes to **existing** auras, click `Apply To All`. If you’re only using macros or behavior trees, this step is optional but harmless.

## Option #2 Macro / Behavior Tree Properties
- Select any macro or behavior tree
- Then select the **root node** – in macros it’s the first line; in trees, the node labeled `Root`
- In the settings on the right, check `Input Simulator` and select `TetherScript Driver`
- All input actions in that macro/tree will now use the driver

## Option #3 **(legacy)** Send Sequence Properties
- Select an aura that contains a `Send Sequence` action
- Expand `Advanced Settings`
- In the `Input Simulator` dropdown, choose `TetherScript Driver`
- This action will now send input using the driver

# What is TetherScript?
**TetherScript** is the company behind [ControlMyJoystick](https://tetherscript.com/controlmyjoystick-home/), a tool that emulates both gamepad and keyboard/mouse input.  
We are **not** using the full software — only the driver component. EyeAuras will send commands directly to this driver.  

From the OS perspective, input sent via this driver is almost indistinguishable from input generated by a physical keyboard or mouse.

Most anti-cheat systems do **not** detect this driver’s input as synthetic. In fact, after 4 years of usage, there are only a few reports of issues from games like **Valorant** or **Fortnite**, which either block input or refuse to launch when the driver is installed. Outside of competitive FPS games, everything works fine.  
EyeAuras was never aimed at creating aimbots — although possible — but rather for automating routine gameplay in MMOs, ARPGs, and browser games.

# How Safe Is It?
**TL;DR** As of **Q2 2025**, TetherScript usage is safe for most games. No known ban waves. If you're not cheating in shooters, you’re likely fine.

There are two sides to "safe":

1) **Functionality**
In most cases, the driver just works. To block it, an anti-cheat would need to blacklist this specific driver and prevent the game from launching.  
However, **ControlMyJoystick** is legitimate software, and such measures would also affect regular users — most anti-cheats prefer to ignore it.

2) **Detection**
The fact that the driver works doesn’t mean it's invisible.  

From the OS view, you'll have **multiple input devices** sending events at once. Technically this is detectable. What games do with that info varies.  
Usually, anti-cheats will just flag the presence of an unusual input device. This flag **does not mean** you're breaking rules — it’s just logged.  
But if you accumulate **multiple flags** (AFK farming, RMT behavior, long session time, etc.), this might trigger a manual review, and at that point *how* you simulate input won’t matter much.
