The Delay Action is a simple tool enabling users to control the timing and flow between actions. This can be particularly useful when you need a certain amount of time to pass before the next action is executed.

### **Delay in milliseconds**

This option allows you to specify the delay duration in milliseconds (ms). The action execution will pause for the time specified here before moving on to the next action in the sequence.

### **Randomize**

If you want to introduce an element of randomness to your delays, you can use the Randomize option. By specifying a Min (minimum) and Max (maximum) range, the system will randomly pick a delay duration within this range for each execution. This can make the behaviors driven by your triggers feel more dynamic and less predictable.

### Gaming applications

-   **Cooldown Simulation:** Add a delay action between ability usage in a game to simulate cooldown times.
-   **NPC Dialogue Timing:** Randomize delays between non-player character (NPC) dialogue lines to make interactions feel more dynamic and natural.
-   **Randomized Encounters:** In an RPG, use random delays between encounters to increase unpredictability.
-   **Platformer Mechanics:** Use delay actions to time platform movements in a platformer game.
