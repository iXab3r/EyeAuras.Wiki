The Play Sound Action is a feature in EyeAuras that allows the user to play a specific sound using the default output device. It's a very convenient way to get audible alerts or feedback while using the system.

Here are the options available in the Play Sound Action:

**Notification**

This option allows you to choose a sound to play. You can either select a sound from a predefined list of notifications embedded into EyeAuras, or load a sound from a file. If you load a sound from a file, that sound will be stored inside the action, so it's okay if the original file is renamed or deleted afterwards.

### **Volume**

This controls the volume at which the notification sound will be played. Adjusting this allows you to make sure the sound is audible without being overly disruptive.

### **Play in Background**

This option is enabled by default. If this is enabled, EyeAuras will start playing the notification sound in the background and immediately move on to any subsequent actions. This means that the action does not block or delay other actions from happening. If this option is disabled, EyeAuras will wait until the entire notification sound has been played before proceeding with other actions.

The Play Sound Action is especially useful in scenarios where you need immediate auditory feedback, like games, monitoring systems, or any applications requiring real-time alerts or notifications.

### Gaming applications

-   **Health Warning**: In games where players have health bars, the trigger could be set to play a sound whenever the health bar decreases significantly, warning the player they're in danger.
-   **Loot Alert**: When a rare loot drop or currency appears on the screen in games like Path of Exile, a unique sound could alert the player.
-   **Cooldown Completion**: In games with abilities that have cooldown periods, a sound could play when the cooldown period ends, indicating the ability is ready to be used again.
-   **Enemy Spotting**: In stealth-based games, a sound could play whenever an enemy is spotted on the screen, alerting the player to their presence.
-   **Game State Changes**: Sounds could be played when transitioning from different game states, such as from peaceful to combat mode in RPG games.
-   **Resource Gathering Reminder**: In games where resource gathering is crucial, a sound could be played when resources are ready to be harvested.
-   **In-Game Day/Night Cycle**: In games with day/night cycles, sounds could be played to indicate the transition from day to night and vice versa.
-   **In-Game Event Alerts**: For games that have random in-game events, a sound could be played to alert the player of the event's initiation.
-   **FPS Ammo Alert**: In first-person shooter games, a sound could be played when the player is running low on ammunition, prompting them to reload or find more.
